Dependent on the opinions of Putin, Merkel, Hollande… They have been given a certain attitude pattern, and they are pursuing it, even at the expense of national interests. At the expense of what is the most sacred to us - the blood shed in the Maidan and during the war. This very pattern is to blame for most of the troubles. I realized it during the siege of the Donetsk airport. They begged me for a long time to take the Right Sector out when the volume of fighting went down due to the quite delusive ‘truce’. At the end of November, I ordered my volunteers out of the airport. When still there, my guys often stopped the servicemen from running away and literally did not allow them to give up the airport under the barrel of a gun. Twice we were given the order to leave.
