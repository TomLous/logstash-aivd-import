The big logistical sticking-points I can see are actually Beverley and Lesley’s disappearances and returns. You can send people off-page in books in a way that you can’t in shows. This applies especially for Beverley, who is a big presence in RoL and FS but is entirely absent for MoS/WU and only shows up twice in BH - I don’t think you could rely on getting the same actress back if you stuck to her book presence.\n But Lesley, while she has a presence in all five books, is only really there via phone/text/email for both MoS and FS. I imagine any make-up/special effects for her injuries would be quite onerous, too, so I suspect show!Lesley would keep her mask on most of the time except for specific scenes (vs. Lesley eventually leaving it off in the Folly by BH.) And FS ditches the entire regular cast except for Peter and Beverley (again, a lot easier to do in a book.) \n\nAnd a lot of the minor characters pop in and out - e.g. Seawoll, there in a major way in RoL/WU but not the other books; Guleed, introduced in MoS, present for WU, and sounds like she’ll play a larger role in the next book; or Postmartin, who has brief appearances in MoS and BH only. Then there’s all the Rivers. \n\nOr things like Peter’s internal narration, which provides quite a lot of the action - he’s not actually very talkative, if you stop and look at what he says to people, it’s all in his head. Either show!Peter needs to articulate his thoughts a lot more or…voiceover, I guess? The show would also have the opportunity to have scenes which are not from Peter’s PoV, which could be very interesting. \n\nAnyway, I know precisely nothing about how all this really works but it’s fun to speculate about what they might/could do. What do you guys think? \n\n the minor characters are not as big of a deal because you can sort of just add them in and give them a couple lines at crime scenes.\nI can never trust people making urban fantasy because i remember the disaster that was Dresden Files the tv show. I mean you are gonna make a show and then not have John Marcone in it at all, what is the point.]\n\nfor Beverly and Lesley, they don’t actually cross over that much, so you can probably expand the parts where they are in plot prominently, so the actresses can take turns being in a large role and then sort of cameoing in the other episodes. (i think you can watch Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries to see how some of the characters disappear and then reappear without much fanfare)\nwhat i’m more worried about is if a tv series would do a Molly/Nightingale angle, to make him seem more hetero. which i would not be able to handle\ni would love to see mama thames’ backstory done in flashback though,\nI think it will be easier to visualize a tv show once that comic comes out. A lot of tv shows get pitched successfully with a comic book anyway, so the producers can actually see how it might look visually. \nThe people who’ve optioned RoL are doing the Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell miniseries that’s coming later this year, so that should be a good indicator of whether they know how to adapt a book in a way that works - but yeah, most successful TV urban fantasy is original. \n\nBeverley’s entirely out of the picture - as in Peter has zero contact with her - for 2.5/5 books, which is a bigger deal than just being more prominent in some episodes than others. With MFMM there’s actually only been two seasons to date so it’s more a case of main cast vs. recurring characters - the lead four characters are in every episode to some extent. \nI don’t think there’s much danger of a TV show doing more with Molly/Nightingale than the very vague gestures the books have made in that direction - although I wouldn’t be thrilled by that, either, it’s the only potentially canon ship in the books I have serious issues with. \nGood point about the comic book. We should be getting really close to that actually coming out - it’s supposed to be May…\n\nI feel like expanding Beverley’s role when she’s offscreen from Peter’s POV is super easy though? Just show what she’s up to with the Thames boys, talking about watersheds, hanging out with Isis and Oxley, planning the court thing or whatever. It’s an easy way to build out the world without disrupting the plot of MoS. \n\nLesley in MoS is harder given what she’s probably up to during that book. Depending on the timing though, they can also do things like have Peter and Lesley meet up after her appointment or something. \n\nYou can totally do that re: Beverley’s stuff, it’s just that in the books to date she’s stayed relatively mysterious to Peter and it depends how much they want to, I guess, de-mistify the Rivers. It’d also be weird to have her doing her own thing with zero contact with Peter, on a show - unless you do have her and Peter stay in touch, which makes the Simone thing weird, which…I mean, it’s totally doable, it just requires a lot of new material (& new characters? since the only Thames boy we know is Ash and he’s in London for that time period) and thinking about the knock-on effects. But yeah, if it’s done intelligently there could be some really interesting worldbuilding there. (I would love to see Beverley making friends with people upstream/learning to love ecology, actually.)\n\nWith Lesley in MoS you could have scenes where we see her end of phonecalls, that sort of thing, but yeah, she kind of has to be mostly offstage to give her room to do…whatever it was she was doing. Makes it harder to drop clues without giving away the big plot twist there. \n\nIt’s quite possible that while the cases in the books will form the rough backbone of each series, a lot of new material will be added in that can enrich the worldbuilding and add to the canon - even b-plots etc involving some of the less-used characters. Lesley could be shown doing things that don’t necessarily pre-empt the big reveal, but do explore her character more. Same potential - as you say - for Beverley upstream, or the Rivers in general.\n\nSo it might not be a straight adaptation, but just using the book(s) as a skeleton and fleshing them out rather a lot. This also works as a way of substituting for the narration-worldbuilding; there’s the scope for flashbacks and all sorts of things to show (rather than tell) a lot of the things Peter narrates.\nBut yeah, the books are so centred on Peter and his discovery of things that it would be very different if it were to be opened out like that.\n\nOne thing that occurs: if RoL was originally conceived as a series format, I suspect there might be a proto-structure in place from back then, before it became a book. And it might be a sort of child of both of those things that becomes a RoL series.\n\nGood point. I was thinking about it and there’s really no case plot that has to stay to keep the main plot arcs going, after the first book; you could have totally different cases or re-jig them fairly severely and it would still move forward. The cases are just kind of what they’re doing while the other stuff plays out, in a lot of ways. You need the two major plots from the first book to set up Lesley And All That and the Rivers, but that’s about it. If it was me I’d really want to keep the MoS plot for the “that makes me shallow, not wrong” argument, because I think that’s really critical, but I guess if you wanted to drop Simone - and she is easily the most disposable character with the most screentime - you could set up another way to have that discussion. Even the BH plot could go quite differently as long as you land the final couple of scenes in some way. \n\nWhich is all sort of driving home how Peter is the narrator but Lesley carries the through-plot, interestingly enough. \n\nYes, that’s a great point…\n\nI think the best approach would be the excellent one taken by The Hunger Games films. There are things which must have gone on out of the narrative point of view that are implied by the text that can be fleshed out. Parts of the story that must have happened - like Nightingale approaching the Commissioner - but aren’t part of Peter’s experience can be used to flecsh out the background.\nIf you use Bev as a recurring character you’d probably get to hang onto the same actress. What would probably need to happen would be for Beverley either not to be the young river who is part of the exchange and for her to have her own plot added during MoS (being suspicious of Simone, investigating her on her own account, maybe making contact one-to-one with Nightingale for the first time - or even Peter’s mother!) which sets up Nightingale sending her after Peter in FG OR give Bev her own plotline that happens upriver - explore Father Thames background and his knowledge of the Punch revenant. Get information to Peter via Bev for RoL. Then you create a new upriver arc for MoS that somehow mirrors Peter’s arc with Simone.\nI suspect that the TV series won’t stick directly to the books, at least after RoL. Or, a bit like Wire in the Blood, they’ll adapt the books at intervals with filler arcs written specifically for the TV series in between.\nOh, and the comic book has slipped a month already so we’re officially on Aaronovitch time … anyone want to open a book one when it’ll actually appear? And we have November as a date for THT - I’ll take February for that! (just in case BA reads this or anyone else thinks I’m being unwarrantedly snarky, this is intended as good natured teasing with no malice! As long as the books continue to appear I’m grateful…)\nWell, per the Con or Bust auction “late May/early June” is probably a good guess for the comic book, since that’s when they’re promising it to the auction winner…not taking bets on the next book, it’s going to show up when it’s finished. At least we’ve got the comic book to get us by in the meantime! \n\n","created_at":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 19:13:21 +0000","hashtags":["rivers of london","rivers of london body work"],"id":"1e4e85a796f5ae808422144f7f3bf275","link":"http://sixth-light.tumblr.com/","media_type":"text","received_at":1429643604.8856001,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"post","blog":{"description":"Queer lady Pākehā scientist.
