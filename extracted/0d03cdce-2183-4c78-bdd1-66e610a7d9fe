The Art of Living and ,its sister organization, IAHV have been working to bring relief to refugees and internally displaced people (IDP). From its base in Erbil, the team has brought relief in the form of food, water and hygiene products to 5 different camps, each camp sheltering 550 Iraqi families. IAHV has reached more than 2,000 families. Additionally, three Kurdish Members of Parliament who recently participated in IAHV\u2019s TLEX training in late June 2014 also came to the aid of refugees visiting the camps, meeting refugees \nand assessing their needs and distributing relief items (see photos below).\n\nThe living conditions of the refugees are extremely poor. In Duhok there are 100,000 refugees, and only one small camp. Most of the refugees are not living there they're living on the streets or in unfinished buildings because the camp is in terrible condition. It is very unhygienic; there are no blankets, coolers or food. There are no bathrooms or toilets. The children are all getting skin disease because of the unhygienic conditions.\n\nCurrently, they lack even the most basic items for survival, such as food, clothing and hygienic kits. They are in a very poor psychological state. One such example is of a refugee who had 37 people in the family taken by ISIS. Thousands of women are abducted, gang-raped and sold in markets. Duhok needs additional camps with conditions that meet basic human needs to be lived in.\n\nThe IAHV team also went to Mount Sinjar to visit the camps where Yazidis have taken refuge. Two graduates of IAHV\u2019s Community Leadership Training program interviewed Yazidi families to document their plight and need for immediate aid in these two brief videos. One of the graduates and her father, Bareza, are taking much needed action to aid the Yazidis with their Foundation:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3ZIJl5UuI&feature=youtu.be\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjDpKNrknM&feature=youtu.be", "source": "Status (25554907596)", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/100002419276417_715035271920442", "subtype": "link", "received_at": 1414412234.7172, "media_type": "link", "type": "facebook", "id": "1e45dd322209a200e0662416e032f13c", "tags": ["tab7"], "schema": {"version": 3}}, "language": {"confidence": 99, "tag": "en", "tag_extended": "en"}, "links": {"code": [200], "title": ["Art of Living and IAHV Response to Iraq... - The Art of Living | Facebook"], "url": ["https://www.facebook.com/TheArtOfLivingGlobal/posts/749848838403460"], "created_at": ["Mon, 27 Oct 2014 11:06:47 +0000"], "meta": {"lang": ["en"], "charset": ["CP1252"], "description": ["Art of Living and IAHV Response to Iraq Refugee Crisis Since the early stages of the ISIS insurgence in Iraq, over 1.5 million Iraqis have been..."]}, "normalized_url": ["https://facebook.com/TheArtOfLivingGlobal/posts/749848838403460"]}, "enrich": {"facebook": [{"username": "guddu.rajesh", "first_name": "Rajesh", "last_name": "Kundu", "name": "Rajesh Kundu", "locale": "en_US", "gender": "male", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/guddu.rajesh", "id": "100002419276417"}]}, "demographic": {"gender": "male"}, "facebook": {"picture": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/p100x100/10342925_749848248403519_748801771361324253_n.jpg?oh=800cd142fe786793b67cf772248daa24&oe=54E67A36&__gda__=1424180051_90dd3d04c5b67775f93a32a6c6a5386c", "description": "Art of Living and IAHV Response to Iraq Refugee Crisis\n\nSince the early stages of the ISIS insurgence in Iraq, over 1.5 million Iraqis have been internally displaced or forced to flee across borders for their safety.
