Oppression is not a contest.\u00A0\nSo let\u2019s see, you basically want to use the worst standards of the world as a benchmark instead of universal human rights, or the UN Millenium Development Goals which lay out the minimum standard of living they believe every human being deserves. That must be it, because why else would you denigrate the purpose of Emma\u2019s speech just because there are other worse problems like I don\u2019t know, poverty, war or disease. So what? Who gets to get oppression solved first? Victims of genocide? Mass rape in warzones? The Iraqi men murdered by ISIS? Is it war or gender inequality first? And then, even within gender inequality we have to go one by one! So who\u2019s first? Women who had their faces splashed with acid for going to school? Women suffering female genital mutilation?\nSo, women in the US denied abortions or suffering domestic violence, sorryyyyyyy your queue number is 6, 384, 933, 327. Cos ya live in the developed world y\u2019know and we gotta have an Oppression Olympics.\nBoy this dystopia you live in where the conversation can only discuss one issue of oppression at a time, where everyone who is oppressed must line up patiently one at a time to have their issues of oppression solved even if it\u2019ll take millennia at this rate- sounds awful.\nBy your ridiculous logic,\u00A0we should cure only the worst diseases one at a time!
