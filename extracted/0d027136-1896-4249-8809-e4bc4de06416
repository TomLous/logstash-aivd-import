Revelation 12:11).</span><br />\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">I personally practice the “shout louder” policy when people try to silence me, self-publishing my book <a href=\"http://superstore.wnd.com/books/Current-Affairs/A-Queer-Thing-Happened-to-America-Hardcover?promocode=story\">“A Queer Thing Happened to America”</a>\n when it was deemed too hot to handle by other publishers, even putting \ntheir rejections on the back cover, calling it, “The Book the Publishers\n Were Afraid to Touch,” and naming my publishing company EqualTime \nbooks.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">And on a regular basis, I confront the evils of radical Islam, \nstating that while it is not the only expression of Islam, it is a valid\n expression of Islam based on the Quran and the example of Muhammad.</span><br />\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Accusing me of cowardice is as silly as claiming I don’t have a mustache.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">More importantly, in my column, I spoke of Pamela Geller’s \n“tremendous courage” and wrote that, “I commend her along with others … \nfor refusing to bow to intimidation and fear.”</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">I also stated that “I defend Geller’s right to hold the contest,” \npointing out that I have had some of her colleagues on my radio show \n(including Robert Spencer, who spoke at the contest) and that I \nfrequently link to their websites, often retweeting Geller’s tweets as \nwell.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">I also understand that Christians are not killing Muslims for \ninsulting our faith but that Muslims are killing us simply for following\n Jesus and that a contest like this is a way for Americans to say, “Not \nin our country!”</span><br />\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Again, I absolutely defend our rights to do so and commend the courage of those who do.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">I simply stated that from the perspective of sharing the gospel with \nMuslims, most of whom are not murderous, I found the cartoon contest to \nbe an unnecessary provocation.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">If you differ with my assessment, I have no problem with it \nwhatsoever, because I agree that Sharia law must be resisted and that \nfree speech is critically important.</span><br />\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">But just as I speak the truth about homosexual “marriage,” knowing \nthat in doing so I will offend LGBT readers and listeners, I don’t call \nthem “faggots” or the like, and I do my best to speak the truth in love.\n Put another way, I know that the truth can offend and will not back \ndown from it, but I do my best not to be offensive.</span><br />\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Perhaps we could learn a lesson from the really courageous ones, the \nChristians being persecuted to the death by Muslims worldwide. They are \nsuffering because they follow Jesus, not because they mock Muhammad.</span><br />\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Again, you can differ with me on the cartoon contest, and that’s fine\n and valid. But for heaven’s sake, if you want to be taken seriously, \ndrop the “cowardice” rhetoric.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">It may apply to some, but it certainly doesn’t apply here.</span><br />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><i>Media wishing to interview Michael Brown, please contact <a href=\"mailto:media@wnd.com\">media@wnd.com</a>.</i></span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><code></code></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><code>\n<table align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border: 2px solid #cccccc; width: 570px;\" summary=\"WND News Alerts Part 2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); width: 550px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><br /></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</code></span></div>\n</header><span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"></span></div>\n</div>","contenttype":"html","created_at":"Sun, 10 May 2015 11:12:00 +0000","id":"1e4f70560ddca000e0727f7fe5e295c4","link":"http://thelightseed.blogspot.com/2015/05/my-response-to-those-calling-me-cowardly.html","received_at":1431329591.9142001,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","title":"My response to those calling me 'cowardly'","type":"blog","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"links":{"code":[200,200],"created_at":["Mon, 11 May 2015 07:33:11 +0000","Mon, 11 May 2015 07:33:12 +0000"],"domain":["wnd.com","wnd.com"],"meta":{"charset":["","CP1252"],"content_type":["image/jpeg","text/html"],"description":["","A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997"],"lang":["","en-us"],"opengraph":[null,{"image":"http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/05/pamela-geller-150x150.jpg","site_name":"WND","title":"My response to those calling me ‘cowardly’","type":"article","url":"http://www.wnd.com/2015/05/my-response-to-those-calling-me-cowardly/"}]},"normalized_url":["http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/03/Michael-Brown_avatar.jpg","http://wnd.com/2015/05/my-response-to-those-calling-me-cowardly"],"title":["","My response to those calling me ‘cowardly’"],"url":["http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/03/Michael-Brown_avatar.jpg","http://www.wnd.com/2015/05/my-response-to-those-calling-me-cowardly/"]}}
