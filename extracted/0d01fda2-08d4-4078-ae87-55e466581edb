At that point, witnesses say that Servin pulled out a gun and opened fire on the group, hitting Cross in the left hand and Boyd \u2014 an innocent bystander \u2014 in the head.\nChicago Police initially claimed that Cross pulled a gun on Servin, which caused the officer to open fire in \u201Cfear for his life.\u201D An independent investigation found that Cross was unarmed, yet he was still charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault.Rekia Boyd died two days after being removed from life support.

There, they went on a water ride, filled out job applications for the ride, then went to a city park, where they \u201Ctalked and wrestled on the grass.\u201D Some of the girlfriends say they had been drinking, but others deny it. An autopsy found that Miller had been drinking that day.\u00A0At about 12:30 a.m., Miller dropped off all but one of her friends, a 15-year-old girl nicknamed Bug. While heading home to Rubidoux, the car got a flat tire and they stopped at a convenience store. There, according to what friends told lawyers, a white man the young women didn\u2019t know replaced the flat with a spare. But the air pump at the convenience store didn\u2019t work, so they drove to a gas station, less than a mile away, followed by the man. When they realized the spare tire would not hold air, Miller began calling friends for help. Bug hitched a ride to Rubidoux with the man, while Miller waited with the car for her friends to arrive.\nAbout an hour later, one of Miller\u2019s cousins and a friend arrived at the gas station and found Miller locked in her car, with her seat back, music playing on the radio and a .380 semiautomatic pistol in her lap. She didn\u2019t respond to knocks on her window. The cousin and friend thought Miller was foaming at the mouth. They called 911 and reported Tyisha was in distress, and that she had a gun. They then called her aunt\u2019s house to get keys to the car.\nBecause the 911 call reported that Miller had a gun, a police car as well as an ambulance was dispatched. The police arrived approximately two minutes later. They tried to rouse Miller by banging on the windows and eventually breaking them. At this point, police accounts diverge. Two of the officers say Miller reached for her pistol; two said they weren\u2019t sure whether she reached for it or not. The four officers \u2014 all white \u2014 fired about 27 shots, hitting Miller at least a dozen times. The Riverside police have not released tapes or transcripts of the 911 call or of the radio communication among the officers \u2014 a fact that has been singled out by critics, who point out that they had no problem releasing the autopsy report showing that Miller was legally drunk.\nShantel Davis: June 16, 2012\u00A0Unarmed 23-year-old Shantel was fatally shot by an NYPD officer in East Flatbush Thursday.\nAround 5:40PM,\u00A0The New York Daily News\u00A0reports, plainclothes cops spotted Shantel Davis drive erratically in a Toyota Camry she&#8217;d allegedly stolen at gunpoint earlier this month.\nAfter running a series of red lights, she crossed a double yellow line at East 38th Street where, according to NYPD spokesman Paul Browne, she crashed into a minivan.\nAs cops approached Davis&#8212; who had an extensive criminal history,\u00A0including 8 arrests, according to police&#8212; she attempted to open the passenger side door. A cop was hit by the door and pushed backwards. Davis then reportedly went back to the driver&#8217;s side and put the car in reverse, hitting the gas.\nAt the same time, another cop, Detective Phil Atkins, entered the vehicle through the driver&#8217;s side door, attempting to put the car in park. In one hand, he was carrying a gun.\n\"He\u2019s attempting with the other hand to shift the gear into park,\u201D Browne said. \u201CWhen she\u2019s hitting the gas, a single round was discharged from his firearm, striking the woman in the chest.\u201D\nCops then asked Davis to step out of the car, which she did, dramatically stumbling onto the street, bleeding profusely as a large crowd looked on in horror.\u00A0From\u00A0The New York Post:\nA woman from a crowd of about 100 onlookers \u201Ccradled [Davis] in her arms and rubbed her head,\u201D said witness Nacole Daniel, 26.\u201CShe was fighting, but there was so much blood gushing out,\u201D said the woman who comforted Davis.\n\nBrowne said it was still unclear if the the officer intentionally pulled the trigger of if it fired accidentally.\nNeighborhood residents were upset Thursday at what they were concerned was another case of excessive police force. As police descended on the scene of the crime, people screamed, &#8220;Murderers!&#8221;\n\"She did not try to put no car in reverse,\u201D\u00A0one witness said. \u201DThey were already on her, she had nowhere to go.\u201D\nState Assemblyman Nick Perry called for an investigation. \u201CI am seriously concerned that the police may have not acted with good judgement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Deadly force appeared to have been unwarranted in this case.\u201D\nMiriam Carey:\u00A0In the immediate aftermath of Thursday\u2019s fatal shooting of Miriam Carey by DC police (after she rammed into barricades near the White House and led a police chase), the media instantly delivered a certain narrative: A crazy, dangerous, armed shooter was endangering the lives of prominent DC officials and needed to be taken down for safety reasons. When that story was undermined by subsequent developments, a new explanation dominated: The victim was mentally ill and had presumably done crazy things that necessitated her deadly shooting.\nBut while Carey\u2019s family since corroborated that she indeed suffered from mental illness, the temptation to use this confirmation as evidence that the media (and police) handled this tragedy appropriately, is misguided. Like\u00A0Alec MacGillis\u00A0and\u00A0several\u00A0others, I am skeptical of the insistence that her shooting was necessary and inevitable.\nFor one thing, at least one part of the chaotic series of events was clarified: Carey wasunarmed\u00A0and\u00A0shot\u00A0after having gotten out of her car.Several\u00A0sites\u00A0ran with headlines suggesting that Carey was mentally ill and a\u00A0deadbeat\u00A0(as if being behind on condo fees automatically makes one a National Security threat). The New York Daily News, whose history includes\u00A0sensational headlines\u00A0and\u00A0innuendos, remained true to\u00A0itself.\u00A0 At that point (Thursday afternoon, as Carey had just been shot), there was no explicit connection between her post-partum story and her actions near the Capitol, but that didn\u2019t stop the tabloid\u2019s\u00A0editors from leading with innuendo.\u00A0\nIt is certainly true that defense attorneys for women on trial for killing their children, such asSusan Smith\u00A0or\u00A0Paula Thompson, have used post-partum as the basis of insanity defenses. But defense strategies are a poor foundation for identifying post-partum depression with violent tendencies, unless substantial proof is demonstrated.\nMoreover, we heard from neighbors and friends that they thought of her as a happy person, a \u201Ccatch,\u201D a great mother, and a\u00A0role model. But those details weren\u2019t in most headlines. By Friday afternoon, nearly every single media story highlighted Carey\u2019s depression and her temper to harden the initial assumption that she was crazy and angry\u2014if not violent.\nNever for a moment, do these reporters consider that Black men and women have always been smeared with these traits, regardless of proof. Miriam Carey is subject to these terms\u2014even though there are plenty of witnesses who describe her as upbeat, cheerful, strong, pleasant, happy. These are, in the ironic words of philosopher Charles Mills, part of \u201Can epistemology of ignorance\u201D features of a world made up by whites that preclude a more candid, historically aware, sympathetic understanding of social realities.\nPerhaps Carey had a \u201Cchip on her shoulder\u201D because she had to struggle twice as hard as someone who came from money to acquire the successes that she had. Perhaps she had a chip on her shoulder because she was being treated unfairly by her bosses and co-workers. But chances are, we\u2019ll never find out.\nNot only because she\u2019s dead, but because the same reporters who have no problems casting aspersions on her personality and temper would never write a story casting aspersions on her employers\u2019 tales about why she was fired, or casting doubt on the police\u2019s story about why they shot her dead.\nAiyanna Jones:\u00A0\u00A0Aiyana Mo&#8217;nay Stanley-Jones, slept on the couch as her grandmother watched television. A half-dozen masked officers of the Special Response Team\u2014Detroit&#8217;s version of SWAT\u2014were at the door, guns drawn.The SWAT team tried the steel door to the building. It was\u00A0unlocked. They threw a flash-bang grenade through the window of the lower unit and kicked open its wooden door, which was also unlocked. The grenade landed so close to Aiyana that it burned her blanket. Officer Joseph Weekley, the lead commando\u2014who&#8217;d been featured before on another A&amp;E show,\u00A0Detroit SWAT\u2014burst into the house. His weapon fired a single shot, the bullet striking Aiyana in the head and exiting her neck. It all happened in a matter of seconds.Police\u00A0first floated\u00A0the story that Aiyana&#8217;s grandmother had grabbed Weekley&#8217;s gun. Then, realizing that sounded implausible, they said she&#8217;d brushed the gun as she ran past the door. But the grandmother says she was lying on the far side of the couch, away from the door.\nCompounding the tragedy is the fact that the police threw the grenade into the wrong apartment. The suspect fingered for Blake&#8217;s murder, Chauncey Owens, lived in the\u00A0upstairs\u00A0flat, with Charles Jones&#8217; sister.\nPlus, grenades are rarely used when rounding up suspects, even murder suspects. But it was dark. And TV may have needed some pyrotechnics.\n\"I&#8217;m worried they went Hollywood,\" said a high-ranking Detroit police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation and simmering resentment in the streets. \"It is not protocol. And I&#8217;ve got to say in all my years in the department, I&#8217;ve never used a flash-bang in a case like this.\"\nThe official went on to say that the SWAT team was not briefed about the presence of children in the house, although the neighborhood informant who led homicide detectives to the Lillibridge address told them that children lived there. There were even\u00A0toys\u00A0on the lawn.\nTarika Wilson:\u00A0A SWAT team arrived at Ms. Wilson\u2019s rented house in the Southside neighborhood early in the evening of Jan. 4 to arrest her companion, Anthony Terry, on suspicion of drug dealing, said Greg Garlock, Lima\u2019s police chief. Officers bashed in the front door and entered with guns drawn, said neighbors who saw the raid.\nMoments later, the police opened fire, killing Ms. Wilson, 26, and wounding her 14-month-old son, Sincere, Chief Garlock said. One officer involved in the raid, Sgt. Joseph Chavalia, a 31-year veteran, has been placed on paid administrative leave.\nBeyond these scant certainties, there is mostly rumor and rage. The police refuse to give any account of the raid, pending an investigation by the Ohio attorney general.\nBlack people in Lima, from the poorest citizens to religious and business leaders, complain that rogue police officers regularly stop them without cause, point guns in their faces, curse them and physically abuse them. They say the shooting of Ms. Wilson is only the latest example of a long-running pattern of a few white police officers treating African-Americans as people to be feared.\nAlesia Thomas:\u00A0Alesia Thomas lost consciousness and\u00A0died in Los Angeles police custody on July 22, 2013, after being handcuffed, placed in a hobble restraint device (leg restraints) and put into the back of a patrol vehicle.\nPolice went to her LA apartment to arrest the 35-year-old mother\u00A0on charges of child abandonment,\u00A0after she left her two children at a police station. Thomas, who reportedly had a history of mental illness and battled drug addiction, was apparently taking advantage of the city\u2019s \u201Csafe haven\u201D law, which allows struggling parents to surrender their children at certain locations, including police and fire stations, or hospitals. The situation reported escalated when she resisted arrest.\nAccording to police spokesman Sgt. Frank Preciado, there is no arrest report because Thomas died in custody before officers could reach the police station.\nPolice refuse to release the dashcam video that showed exactly what happened to Thomas that morning, but\u00A0assault charges were filed against Officer Mary O\u2019Callaghan, 48. O\u2019Callaghan was seen on video repeatedly kicking Thomas in the stomach and genitals and punching her in the throat.\nA statement released by department officials said officers used \u201Cquestionable tactics\u201D against Thomas while she was restrained, and made \u201Cinappropriate verbal comments.\u201D\nKathyrn Johnson:In November 2006, three officers had entered 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston\u2019s Atlanta home in what was later described as a \u2018botched\u2019 drug raid. Officers cut off burglar bars and broke down her door.\u00A0\u00A0Police said Johnston fired at them and they fired in response; she fired one shot through the door over the officers\u2019 heads. They fired 39 shots, six of which hit the elderly woman.\u00A0\nNone of the officers were injured by her gunfire, but Johnston was killed by the officers. Police injuries were later attributed to \u201Cfriendly fire\u201D from each other\u2019s weapons.\u00A0\nOne of the officers planted\u00A0marijuana\u00A0in Johnston\u2019s house after the shooting. Later investigations found that the paperwork stating that drugs were present at Johnston\u2019s house, which had been the basis for the raid, had been falsified.\u00A0\nThe officers later admitted to having lied when they submitted cocaine as evidence, claiming they had bought it at Johnston\u2019s house. The three officers were tried for manslaughter and other charges surrounding falsification of evidence. One police officer was sentenced to 10 years, another one got six, and the third officer in the case received five years\u2019 imprisonment.\u00A0","tags":["tab8"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"id":"18621275_39287947_94760050394","activity":"Unlikes","created_at":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 00:25:40 +0000","source":{"blogid":"18621275"},"dest":{"blogid":"39287947","postid":"94760050394"},"root":{"blogid":"88384361","postid":"94373385466"},"parent":{"blogid":"10118876","postid":"94760003637"},"meta":{"url":"http://mangoestho.tumblr.com/post/94373385466/we-want-you-all-to-know-and-remember-that-black","type":"photo","description":"\nWe want you all to know and remember that Black girls are always present despite efforts to disappear, displace, and rearrange us.\nI want you to know what the members of Combahee River Collective wanted the world to know: black girls and black women are inherently valuable.

In one hand, he was carrying a gun.\n\"He\u2019s attempting with the other hand to shift the gear into park,\u201D Browne said. \u201CWhen she\u2019s hitting the gas, a single round was discharged from his firearm, striking the woman in the chest.\u201D\nCops then asked Davis to step out of the car, which she did, dramatically stumbling onto the street, bleeding profusely as a large crowd looked on in horror.\u00A0From\u00A0The New York Post:\nA woman from a crowd of about 100 onlookers \u201Ccradled [Davis] in her arms and rubbed her head,\u201D said witness Nacole Daniel, 26.\u201CShe was fighting, but there was so much blood gushing out,\u201D said the woman who comforted Davis.\n\nBrowne said it was still unclear if the the officer intentionally pulled the trigger of if it fired accidentally.\nNeighborhood residents were upset Thursday at what they were concerned was another case of excessive police force. As police descended on the scene of the crime, people screamed, &#8220;Murderers!&#8221;\n\"She did not try to put no car in reverse,\u201D\u00A0one witness said. \u201DThey were already on her, she had nowhere to go.\u201D\nState Assemblyman Nick Perry called for an investigation. \u201CI am seriously concerned that the police may have not acted with good judgement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Deadly force appeared to have been unwarranted in this case.\u201D\nMiriam Carey:\u00A0In the immediate aftermath of Thursday\u2019s fatal shooting of Miriam Carey by DC police (after she rammed into barricades near the White House and led a police chase), the media instantly delivered a certain narrative: A crazy, dangerous, armed shooter was endangering the lives of prominent DC officials and needed to be taken down for safety reasons. When that story was undermined by subsequent developments, a new explanation dominated: The victim was mentally ill and had presumably done crazy things that necessitated her deadly shooting.\nBut while Carey\u2019s family since corroborated that she indeed suffered from mental illness, the temptation to use this confirmation as evidence that the media (and police) handled this tragedy appropriately, is misguided. Like\u00A0Alec MacGillis\u00A0and\u00A0several\u00A0others, I am skeptical of the insistence that her shooting was necessary and inevitable.\nFor one thing, at least one part of the chaotic series of events was clarified: Carey wasunarmed\u00A0and\u00A0shot\u00A0after having gotten out of her car.Several\u00A0sites\u00A0ran with headlines suggesting that Carey was mentally ill and a\u00A0deadbeat\u00A0(as if being behind on condo fees automatically makes one a National Security threat). The New York Daily News, whose history includes\u00A0sensational headlines\u00A0and\u00A0innuendos, remained true to\u00A0itself.\u00A0 At that point (Thursday afternoon, as Carey had just been shot), there was no explicit connection between her post-partum story and her actions near the Capitol, but that didn\u2019t stop the tabloid\u2019s\u00A0editors from leading with innuendo.\u00A0\nIt is certainly true that defense attorneys for women on trial for killing their children, such asSusan Smith\u00A0or\u00A0Paula Thompson, have used post-partum as the basis of insanity defenses. But defense strategies are a poor foundation for identifying post-partum depression with violent tendencies, unless substantial proof is demonstrated.\nMoreover, we heard from neighbors and friends that they thought of her as a happy person, a \u201Ccatch,\u201D a great mother, and a\u00A0role model. But those details weren\u2019t in most headlines. By Friday afternoon, nearly every single media story highlighted Carey\u2019s depression and her temper to harden the initial assumption that she was crazy and angry\u2014if not violent.\nNever for a moment, do these reporters consider that Black men and women have always been smeared with these traits, regardless of proof. Miriam Carey is subject to these terms\u2014even though there are plenty of witnesses who describe her as upbeat, cheerful, strong, pleasant, happy. These are, in the ironic words of philosopher Charles Mills, part of \u201Can epistemology of ignorance\u201D features of a world made up by whites that preclude a more candid, historically aware, sympathetic understanding of social realities.\nPerhaps Carey had a \u201Cchip on her shoulder\u201D because she had to struggle twice as hard as someone who came from money to acquire the successes that she had. Perhaps she had a chip on her shoulder because she was being treated unfairly by her bosses and co-workers. But chances are, we\u2019ll never find out.\nNot only because she\u2019s dead, but because the same reporters who have no problems casting aspersions on her personality and temper would never write a story casting aspersions on her employers\u2019 tales about why she was fired, or casting doubt on the police\u2019s story about why they shot her dead.\nAiyanna Jones:\u00A0\u00A0Aiyana Mo&#8217;nay Stanley-Jones, slept on the couch as her grandmother watched television. A half-dozen masked officers of the Special Response Team\u2014Detroit&#8217;s version of SWAT\u2014were at the door, guns drawn.The SWAT team tried the steel door to the building. It was\u00A0unlocked. They threw a flash-bang grenade through the window of the lower unit and kicked open its wooden door, which was also unlocked. The grenade landed so close to Aiyana that it burned her blanket. Officer Joseph Weekley, the lead commando\u2014who&#8217;d been featured before on another A&amp;E show,\u00A0Detroit SWAT\u2014burst into the house. His weapon fired a single shot, the bullet striking Aiyana in the head and exiting her neck. It all happened in a matter of seconds.Police\u00A0first floated\u00A0the story that Aiyana&#8217;s grandmother had grabbed Weekley&#8217;s gun. Then, realizing that sounded implausible, they said she&#8217;d brushed the gun as she ran past the door. But the grandmother says she was lying on the far side of the couch, away from the door.\nCompounding the tragedy is the fact that the police threw the grenade into the wrong apartment. The suspect fingered for Blake&#8217;s murder, Chauncey Owens, lived in the\u00A0upstairs\u00A0flat, with Charles Jones&#8217; sister.\nPlus, grenades are rarely used when rounding up suspects, even murder suspects. But it was dark. And TV may have needed some pyrotechnics.\n\"I&#8217;m worried they went Hollywood,\" said a high-ranking Detroit police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation and simmering resentment in the streets. \"It is not protocol. And I&#8217;ve got to say in all my years in the department, I&#8217;ve never used a flash-bang in a case like this.\"\nThe official went on to say that the SWAT team was not briefed about the presence of children in the house, although the neighborhood informant who led homicide detectives to the Lillibridge address told them that children lived there. There were even\u00A0toys\u00A0on the lawn.\nTarika Wilson:\u00A0A SWAT team arrived at Ms. Wilson\u2019s rented house in the Southside neighborhood early in the evening of Jan. 4 to arrest her companion, Anthony Terry, on suspicion of drug dealing, said Greg Garlock, Lima\u2019s police chief. Officers bashed in the front door and entered with guns drawn, said neighbors who saw the raid.\nMoments later, the police opened fire, killing Ms. Wilson, 26, and wounding her 14-month-old son, Sincere, Chief Garlock said. One officer involved in the raid, Sgt. Joseph Chavalia, a 31-year veteran, has been placed on paid administrative leave.\nBeyond these scant certainties, there is mostly rumor and rage. The police refuse to give any account of the raid, pending an investigation by the Ohio attorney general.\nBlack people in Lima, from the poorest citizens to religious and business leaders, complain that rogue police officers regularly stop them without cause, point guns in their faces, curse them and physically abuse them. They say the shooting of Ms. Wilson is only the latest example of a long-running pattern of a few white police officers treating African-Americans as people to be feared.\nAlesia Thomas:\u00A0Alesia Thomas lost consciousness and\u00A0died in Los Angeles police custody on July 22, 2013, after being handcuffed, placed in a hobble restraint device (leg restraints) and put into the back of a patrol vehicle.\nPolice went to her LA apartment to arrest the 35-year-old mother\u00A0on charges of child abandonment,\u00A0after she left her two children at a police station. Thomas, who reportedly had a history of mental illness and battled drug addiction, was apparently taking advantage of the city\u2019s \u201Csafe haven\u201D law, which allows struggling parents to surrender their children at certain locations, including police and fire stations, or hospitals. The situation reported escalated when she resisted arrest.\nAccording to police spokesman Sgt. Frank Preciado, there is no arrest report because Thomas died in custody before officers could reach the police station.\nPolice refuse to release the dashcam video that showed exactly what happened to Thomas that morning, but\u00A0assault charges were filed against Officer Mary O\u2019Callaghan, 48. O\u2019Callaghan was seen on video repeatedly kicking Thomas in the stomach and genitals and punching her in the throat.\nA statement released by department officials said officers used \u201Cquestionable tactics\u201D against Thomas while she was restrained, and made \u201Cinappropriate verbal comments.\u201D\nKathyrn Johnson:In November 2006, three officers had entered 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston\u2019s Atlanta home in what was later described as a \u2018botched\u2019 drug raid. Officers cut off burglar bars and broke down her door.\u00A0\u00A0Police said Johnston fired at them and they fired in response; she fired one shot through the door over the officers\u2019 heads. They fired 39 shots, six of which hit the elderly woman.\u00A0\nNone of the officers were injured by her gunfire, but Johnston was killed by the officers. Police injuries were later attributed to \u201Cfriendly fire\u201D from each other\u2019s weapons.\u00A0\nOne of the officers planted\u00A0marijuana\u00A0in Johnston\u2019s house after the shooting. Later investigations found that the paperwork stating that drugs were present at Johnston\u2019s house, which had been the basis for the raid, had been falsified.\u00A0\nThe officers later admitted to having lied when they submitted cocaine as evidence, claiming they had bought it at Johnston\u2019s house. The three officers were tried for manslaughter and other charges surrounding falsification of evidence. One police officer was sentenced to 10 years, another one got six, and the third officer in the case received five years\u2019 imprisonment.\u00A0","likes_local":40,"likes_global":6001,"reblogged_global":46},"post_url":"http://mangoestho.tumblr.com/post/94373385466/we-want-you-all-to-know-and-remember-that-black","type":"photo"}}
