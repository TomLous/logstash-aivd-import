That is what the White  House fears, and that explains its rage over Netanyahu's appearance.<br /><br /> Tehran may overplay its hand, but I do not think it will. The  Persians are not the Palestinians, who discovered that they were a  people only a generation ago and never miss an opportunity to miss and  opportunity; they are ancient and crafty, and know an opportunity when  it presents itself.<br /><br /> Most of the world wants a deal, because the alternative would be war.  For 10 years I have argued that war is inevitable whatever the  diplomats do, and that the question is not if, but how and when.  President Obama is not British prime minister Neville Chamberlain  selling out to Hitler at Munich in 1938: rather, he is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2650832/Lord-Halifax-tried-to-negotiate-peace-with-the-Nazis.html\">Lord Halifax</a>,  that is, Halifax if he had been prime minister in 1938. Unlike the  unfortunate Chamberlain, who hoped to buy time for Britain to build  warplanes, Halifax liked Hitler, as Obama and his camarilla admire Iran.<br /><br /> China is Chamberlain, hoping to placate Iran in order to buy time.  China's dependence on Middle East oil will increase during the next  decade no matter what else China might do, and a war in the Persian Gulf  would ruin it.<br /><br /> Until early 2014, China believed that the United States would  guarantee the security of the Persian Gulf. After the rise of Islamic  State (ISIS), it concluded that the United States no longer cared, or  perhaps intended to destabilize the region for nefarious reasons. But  China does not have means to replace America's presence in the Persian  Gulf. Like Chamberlain at Munich, it seeks delay.<br /><br /> Obama, to be sure, portrays his policy in the language of balance of power. He told the New Yorker's David Remnick in 2014,<br /> <blockquote><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"> It would be profoundly in  the interest of citizens throughout the region if Sunnis and Shias  weren't intent on killing each other. And although it would not solve  the entire problem, if we were able to get Iran to operate in a  responsible fashion - not funding terrorist organizations, not trying to  stir up sectarian discontent in other countries, and not developing a  nuclear weapon - you could see an equilibrium developing between Sunni,  or predominantly Sunni, Gulf states and Iran in which there's  competition, perhaps suspicion, but not an active or proxy warfare.</span><br /> </blockquote>That, as the old joke goes, is the demo version.<br /><br /> <table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"width: 300px;\"><tbody><tr><td><b><div style=\"font-size: 18px;\">The US has tacitly accepted the guiding role of Iranian commanders in Iraq's military operations against ISIS.</div></b></td></tr></tbody></table>On the ground, the US has <a href=\"http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense-news/blog/intercepts/2015/03/02/iraq-iran-is-war-terrorism/24270363/\">tacitly accepted</a> the guiding role of Iranian commanders in Iraq's military operations against ISIS.

It looks the other way while its heavy arms shipments to the  Lebanese army are diverted to <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-arming-hezbollah-to-fight-al-qaida-lebanon\">Hezbollah</a>.<br /><br /> At almost every point at which Iran has tried to assert hegemony over  its neighbors, Washington has acquiesced. \"In the end, peace can be  achieved only by hegemony or by balance of power,\" wrote Henry  Kissinger. The major powers hope for peace through Iranian hegemony,  although they differ in their estimate of how long this will last.<br /><br /> Apart from its nuclear ambitions, the broader deal envisioned by  Washington would leave Iran as a de facto suzerain in Iraq. It would  also make Iran the dominant power in Lebanon (via Hezbollah), Syria (via  its client regime) and Yemen (through its Houthi proxies). Although  Sunni Muslims outnumber Shi'ites by 6:1, Sunni populations are  concentrated in North Africa, Turkey and South Asia. Iran hopes to  dominate the Levant and Mesopotamia, encircling Saudi Arabia and  threatening Azerbaijan.<br /><br /> <table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"width: 300px;\"><tbody><tr><td><b><div style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Washington destroyed the balance of power that defined the region's politics when it pushed through majority rule in Iraq.</div></b></td></tr></tbody></table>It is grotesque for America to talk of balance of power in the  Persian Gulf, because America destroyed the balance of power that  defined the region's politics from the end of the First World War until  2006, when Washington pushed through majority rule in Iraq.<br /><br /> The imperialist powers in their wisdom established a power balance on  two levels. First, they created a Sunni-dominated state in Iraq  opposite Shi'ite Iran. The two powers fought each other to a standstill  during the 1980s with the covert encouragement of the Reagan  administration. Nearly a million soldiers died without troubling the  world around them.<br /><br /> Second, the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 created two states, Syria  and Iraq, in which minorities ruled majorities - the Alawite minority in  Syria, and the Sunni minority in Iraq. Tyranny of a minority may be  brutal, but a minority cannot exterminate a majority.<br /><br /> America's first great blunder was to force majority rule upon Iraq. As Lt General (ret.) <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/World/WOR-01-211114.html\">Daniel Bolger</a> explained in a 2014 book,<br /> <blockquote><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The stark facts on the  ground still sat there, oozing pus and bile. With Saddam gone, any  voting would install a Shiite majority. The Sunni wouldn't run Iraq  again. That, at the bottom, caused the insurgency. Absent the genocide  of Sunni Arabs, it would keep it going.</span><br /> </blockquote>Under majority Shi'ite rule, Iraq inevitably became Iran's ally.  Iranian Revolutionary Guards are now leading its campaign against the  Sunni resistance, presently dominated by ISIS, and <a href=\"http://www.iraqoilreport.com/daily-brief/iran-ready-take-iraqs-troops-14083/\">Iranian officers</a> are leading Iraqi army regulars.<br /><br /> This was the work of the George W Bush administration, not Obama. In  its ideological fervor for Arab democracy, the Republicans opened the  door for Iran to dominate the region. Condoleezza Rice, then Bush's  National Security Advisor, proposed offering an olive branch to Iran as  early as 2003. After the Republicans got trounced in the 2006  Congressional elections, defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld got a pink  slip, vice president Dick Cheney got benched, and \"realist\" Robert Gates  - the co-chairman of the 2004 <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/iran/iran-time-new-approach/p7194\">Council on Foreign Relations task force </a> that advocated a deal with Iran - took over at Defense.<br /> <h3>China and Russia</h3>In the past, China has sought to strike a balance between Saudi  Arabia and Iran with weapons sales, among other means. One Chinese  analyst observes that although China's weapons deliveries to Iran are  larger in absolute terms than its sales to Saudi Arabia, it has given  the Saudis its best medium-range missiles, which constitute a  \"formidable deterrent\" against Iran.<br /><br /> <span contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"background-color: yellow; color: black;\"></span><br /><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float: left; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 16px;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"border: 0px solid black; max-width: 350px;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"213\" src=\"http://www.meforum.org/pics/large/1026.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><div style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; margin: 4px 0px;\"><b>A Chinese warship arrives in Bandar Abbas, Iran in September 2014.</b></div></td></tr></tbody></table>As China sees the matter, its overall dependency on imported oil is  rising, and the proportion of that oil coming from Iran and its  perceived allies is rising. Saudi Arabia may be China's biggest  provider, but Iraq and Oman account for lion's share of the recent  increase in oil imports. China doesn't want to rock the boat with either  prospective adversary.<br /><br /> Among the world's powers, China is the supreme rationalist: it views  the world in terms of cold self-interest and tends to assume that others  also view the world this way. One of China's most respected military  strategists told me bluntly that the notion of a nuclear exchange  between Israel and Iran (and by implication any regional nuclear power  and Iran) was absurd: the Iranians, he argued, know that a nuclear-armed  Israel could destroy them in retaliation.<br /><br /> Other Chinese analysts are less convinced and view Iran's prospective  acquisition of nuclear weapons with trepidation. It is not only war  with Israel but with Saudi Arabia that concerns the oil-importing  Chinese. For the time being, Beijing has decided to accommodate Iran. In  a March 2 commentary, <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-03/02/c_134030501.htm\">Xinhua</a> explicitly rejected Israeli objections:<br /> <blockquote><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The US Congress will soon  have a guest, Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, who is expected  to try to convince lawmakers that a deal with Iran on its nuclear  program could threaten the very existence of the Jewish state.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Despite the upcoming pressure,  policymakers in Washington should have a clear mind of the potential  dangers of back-pedaling on the current promising efforts for a  comprehensive deal on the Iranian nuclear issue before a March 31  deadline …</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">With a new round of talks in  Switzerland pending, it is widely expected that the P5+1 [the five  permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany] could succeed  in reaching a deal with Iran to prevent the latter from developing a  nuclear bomb, in exchange for easing sanctions on Tehran.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The momentum does not come easy and  could hardly withstand any disturbances such as a surprise announcement  by Washington to slap further sanctions on Tehran.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Obama administration needs no  outside reminder to know that any measures at this stage to \"overwhelm\"  Iran will definitely cause havoc to the positive atmosphere that came  after years of frustration over the issue.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">While it is impossible for Washington  to insulate itself from the powerful pro-Israel lobbyist this time, the  US policymakers should heed that by deviating from the ongoing endeavor  on Iran they may squander a hard-earned opportunity by the international  community to move closer to a solution to the Iran nuclear issue, for  several years to come if not forever.</span><br /> </blockquote>Russia has taken Iran's side explicitly, for several reasons.<br /> First, Russia has stated bluntly that it would help Iran in retaliation for Western policy in Ukraine, as I wrote in this space <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MID-01-280115.html\">January 28</a>.  Second, Russia's own Muslim problem is Sunni rather than Shi'ite. It  has reason to fear the influence of ISIS among its own Muslims. If Iran  fights ISIS, it serves Russian interests. Russia, to be sure, does not  like the idea of a nuclear power on its southern border, but its  priorities place it squarely in Iran's camp.<br /> <h3>Demographic Time Bomb</h3>The Israeli prime minister asserted that the alternative to a bad  deal is not war, but a better deal. I do not think he believes that, but  Americans cannot wrap their minds around the notion that West Asia will  remain at war indefinitely, especially because the war arises from  their own stupidity.<br /><br /> Balance of power in the Middle East is inherently impossible today  for the same reason it failed in Europe in 1914, namely a grand  demographic disequilibrium: Iran is on a course to demographic disaster,  and must assert its hegemony while it still has time.<br /><br /> Game theorists might argue that Iran has a rational self-interest to  trade its nuclear ambitions for the removal of sanctions. The solution  to a multi-period game - one that takes into account Iran's worsening  demographic weakness - would have a solution in which Iran takes great  risks to acquire nuclear weapons.<br /><br /> Between 30% and 40% of Iranians will be older than 60 by mid-century  (using the UN Population Prospect's Constant Fertility and \"Low\"  Variants). Meanwhile, its military-age population will fall by a third  to a half.<br /><br /> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10554866/Iran-attempts-to-reverse-falling-birth-rate.html\">Belated efforts</a> to promote fertility are unlikely to make a difference. The causes of  Iranian infertility are baked into the cake - higher levels of <a href=\"https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=jHgQWopswvYC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=female+literacy+fertility+iran&source=bl&ots=FjgQQOrDsC&sig=IazAI3s-cIqDAoXaphEonwEB38A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=50z1VOGJF4L18QX7nYKICQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBw\">female literacy</a>, an officially-sanctioned <a href=\"http://www.albawaba.com/behind-news/iran-permits-brothels-through-temporary-marriages\">culture of sexual license</a> administered by the Shi'ite clergy as \"<a href=\"http://en.trend.az/iran/2182691.html\">temporary marriage</a>,\" epidemic levels of <a href=\"http://www.meforum.org/5000/strategic-implications-iran-std\">sexually-transmitted disease</a> and <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/17/the-islamic-republic-of-baby-making/\">inbreeding</a>. Iran, in short, has an apocalyptic regime with a lot to be apocalyptic about.<br /><br /> Henry Kissinger is right: peace can be founded on either hegemony or  balance of power. Iran cannot be a hegemon for long because it will  implode economically and demographically within a generation. In the  absence of either, the result is war. For the past 10 years <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FJ19Aa01.html\">I have argued in this space</a> that when war is inevitable, preemption is the least damaging course of  action. I had hoped that George W Bush would have the gumption to  de-fang Iran, and was disappointed when he came under the influence of  Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates. Now we are back in 1938, but with  Lord Halifax rather than Neville Chamberlain in charge.<br /> <blockquote><b><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"> <i>David P.

As Lt General (ret.) <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/World/WOR-01-211114.html\">Daniel Bolger</a> explained in a 2014 book,<br /> <blockquote><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The stark facts on the  ground still sat there, oozing pus and bile. With Saddam gone, any  voting would install a Shiite majority. The Sunni wouldn't run Iraq  again. That, at the bottom, caused the insurgency. Absent the genocide  of Sunni Arabs, it would keep it going.</span><br /> </blockquote>Under majority Shi'ite rule, Iraq inevitably became Iran's ally.  Iranian Revolutionary Guards are now leading its campaign against the  Sunni resistance, presently dominated by ISIS, and <a href=\"http://www.iraqoilreport.com/daily-brief/iran-ready-take-iraqs-troops-14083/\">Iranian officers</a> are leading Iraqi army regulars.<br /><br /> This was the work of the George W Bush administration, not Obama. In  its ideological fervor for Arab democracy, the Republicans opened the  door for Iran to dominate the region. Condoleezza Rice, then Bush's  National Security Advisor, proposed offering an olive branch to Iran as  early as 2003. After the Republicans got trounced in the 2006  Congressional elections, defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld got a pink  slip, vice president Dick Cheney got benched, and \"realist\" Robert Gates  - the co-chairman of the 2004 <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/iran/iran-time-new-approach/p7194\">Council on Foreign Relations task force </a> that advocated a deal with Iran - took over at Defense.<br /> <h3>China and Russia</h3>In the past, China has sought to strike a balance between Saudi  Arabia and Iran with weapons sales, among other means. One Chinese  analyst observes that although China's weapons deliveries to Iran are  larger in absolute terms than its sales to Saudi Arabia, it has given  the Saudis its best medium-range missiles, which constitute a  \"formidable deterrent\" against Iran.<br /><br /> <span contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"background-color: yellow; color: black;\"></span><br /><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float: left; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 16px;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"border: 0px solid black; max-width: 350px;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"213\" src=\"http://www.meforum.org/pics/large/1026.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><div style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; margin: 4px 0px;\"><b>A Chinese warship arrives in Bandar Abbas, Iran in September 2014.</b></div></td></tr></tbody></table>As China sees the matter, its overall dependency on imported oil is  rising, and the proportion of that oil coming from Iran and its  perceived allies is rising. Saudi Arabia may be China's biggest  provider, but Iraq and Oman account for lion's share of the recent  increase in oil imports. China doesn't want to rock the boat with either  prospective adversary.<br /><br /> Among the world's powers, China is the supreme rationalist: it views  the world in terms of cold self-interest and tends to assume that others  also view the world this way. One of China's most respected military  strategists told me bluntly that the notion of a nuclear exchange  between Israel and Iran (and by implication any regional nuclear power  and Iran) was absurd: the Iranians, he argued, know that a nuclear-armed  Israel could destroy them in retaliation.<br /><br /> Other Chinese analysts are less convinced and view Iran's prospective  acquisition of nuclear weapons with trepidation. It is not only war  with Israel but with Saudi Arabia that concerns the oil-importing  Chinese. For the time being, Beijing has decided to accommodate Iran. In  a March 2 commentary, <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-03/02/c_134030501.htm\">Xinhua</a> explicitly rejected Israeli objections:<br /> <blockquote><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The US Congress will soon  have a guest, Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, who is expected  to try to convince lawmakers that a deal with Iran on its nuclear  program could threaten the very existence of the Jewish state.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Despite the upcoming pressure,  policymakers in Washington should have a clear mind of the potential  dangers of back-pedaling on the current promising efforts for a  comprehensive deal on the Iranian nuclear issue before a March 31  deadline …</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">With a new round of talks in  Switzerland pending, it is widely expected that the P5+1 [the five  permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany] could succeed  in reaching a deal with Iran to prevent the latter from developing a  nuclear bomb, in exchange for easing sanctions on Tehran.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The momentum does not come easy and  could hardly withstand any disturbances such as a surprise announcement  by Washington to slap further sanctions on Tehran.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Obama administration needs no  outside reminder to know that any measures at this stage to \"overwhelm\"  Iran will definitely cause havoc to the positive atmosphere that came  after years of frustration over the issue.</span><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">While it is impossible for Washington  to insulate itself from the powerful pro-Israel lobbyist this time, the  US policymakers should heed that by deviating from the ongoing endeavor  on Iran they may squander a hard-earned opportunity by the international  community to move closer to a solution to the Iran nuclear issue, for  several years to come if not forever.</span><br /> </blockquote>Russia has taken Iran's side explicitly, for several reasons.<br /> First, Russia has stated bluntly that it would help Iran in retaliation for Western policy in Ukraine, as I wrote in this space <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MID-01-280115.html\">January 28</a>.  Second, Russia's own Muslim problem is Sunni rather than Shi'ite. It  has reason to fear the influence of ISIS among its own Muslims. If Iran  fights ISIS, it serves Russian interests. Russia, to be sure, does not  like the idea of a nuclear power on its southern border, but its  priorities place it squarely in Iran's camp.<br /> <h3>Demographic Time Bomb</h3>The Israeli prime minister asserted that the alternative to a bad  deal is not war, but a better deal. I do not think he believes that, but  Americans cannot wrap their minds around the notion that West Asia will  remain at war indefinitely, especially because the war arises from  their own stupidity.<br /><br /> Balance of power in the Middle East is inherently impossible today  for the same reason it failed in Europe in 1914, namely a grand  demographic disequilibrium: Iran is on a course to demographic disaster,  and must assert its hegemony while it still has time.<br /><br /> Game theorists might argue that Iran has a rational self-interest to  trade its nuclear ambitions for the removal of sanctions. The solution  to a multi-period game - one that takes into account Iran's worsening  demographic weakness - would have a solution in which Iran takes great  risks to acquire nuclear weapons.<br /><br /> Between 30% and 40% of Iranians will be older than 60 by mid-century  (using the UN Population Prospect's Constant Fertility and \"Low\"  Variants). Meanwhile, its military-age population will fall by a third  to a half.<br /><br /> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10554866/Iran-attempts-to-reverse-falling-birth-rate.html\">Belated efforts</a> to promote fertility are unlikely to make a difference. The causes of  Iranian infertility are baked into the cake - higher levels of <a href=\"https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=jHgQWopswvYC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=female+literacy+fertility+iran&source=bl&ots=FjgQQOrDsC&sig=IazAI3s-cIqDAoXaphEonwEB38A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=50z1VOGJF4L18QX7nYKICQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBw\">female literacy</a>, an officially-sanctioned <a href=\"http://www.albawaba.com/behind-news/iran-permits-brothels-through-temporary-marriages\">culture of sexual license</a> administered by the Shi'ite clergy as \"<a href=\"http://en.trend.az/iran/2182691.html\">temporary marriage</a>,\" epidemic levels of <a href=\"http://www.meforum.org/5000/strategic-implications-iran-std\">sexually-transmitted disease</a> and <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/17/the-islamic-republic-of-baby-making/\">inbreeding</a>. Iran, in short, has an apocalyptic regime with a lot to be apocalyptic about.<br /><br /> Henry Kissinger is right: peace can be founded on either hegemony or  balance of power. Iran cannot be a hegemon for long because it will  implode economically and demographically within a generation. In the  absence of either, the result is war. For the past 10 years <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FJ19Aa01.html\">I have argued in this space</a> that when war is inevitable, preemption is the least damaging course of  action. I had hoped that George W Bush would have the gumption to  de-fang Iran, and was disappointed when he came under the influence of  Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates. Now we are back in 1938, but with  Lord Halifax rather than Neville Chamberlain in charge.<br /> <blockquote><b><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"> <i>David P.
