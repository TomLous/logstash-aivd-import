Helping out through blogging; sharing of articles, signing petitions, Liking this Tweeting that, and posting the favourites, but now there\u2019s even more to my life than all that. The New Global Campaign Cause Off-Line Petition For June\u2019s Freedom.\n\nFighting for Human rights has always been number one for me (especially for the Transgender; girly-boy, sissy panzy and over the top \u201cto gay\u201d individual such as myself), and right now because of Ignorance & Religious Righteousness; Dictators; Crimes Against Humanity, Homophobia, Femaphobia, Xenophobia, Racism, bullshit government bureaucracy & politics, - personally affecting a loved on of mine in South Africa, , I Have to stop everything and put all my efforts in helping just one person: my beautiful friend -( sister -daughter - brother, and beloved )- in South Africa. \n\nThe Story begins at June\u2019s Facebook Page: http://bitly.com/EqualityMayema then head over to this Facebook page http://on.fb.me/GLBTrefugee and the \u201cNotes Tab\u201d http://on.fb.me/JMblog for regular Blog updating and posting as well as support for others. The Story is not Ended but now continues on over to Causes.com for a NEW GLOBAL CAMPAIGN CAUSE JUST FOR JUNE AND ALL THOSE WISHING TO DO MORE.\n\nNow after everyone catches up on June & Her Life Story, her Awful life story, through her and I and others who write about her, the last thing they\u2019re able to do before they think they can\u2019t do anymore, is head on over to the GLOBAL CAMPAIGN CAUSE @ http://bit.ly/globalofflinecause.  A BRAND NEW GLOBAL CAMPAIGN OFFLINE PETITION FOR THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND HELPING JUNE GET OUT OF AFRICA. !!

Looking forward to hearing from you when ever you want at your own convenience via chat, email, comment, post or phone call. \n\nWith no family, money or place to stay that is safe or secure from sudden threats and danger, My Partner & I are Financially Supporting June from now until how ever long it takes for her to be allowed to leave Africa and live somewhere else. If you can spare 2 - 5 dollars, please head over to the GoFundMe Page @ http://bit.ly/ForJuneFund because my Partner is not a retired Rich Man and I get Disability Assistance from the Government, plus we have our financial problems like everyone else does. However we plan on sending her Money for her most basic essentials of living for how ever long it takes to save her life; paying her very scary way through life and never knowing what terrible thing can happen from one week to the next. \n\nSo we use GoFundMe, and we use them because Crowdrise & Fundstarter no long apply; just in case you see them linked from an older bio or post, at one of the other social networks.  June Fled The Congo to South Africa thinking it would be safe for her there, but it is not, so she must get out, but she\u2018s not allowed and they won\u2018t give her the time of day to consider it. They neglect her and she has to stay longer before even considering anything else. Confusing isn\u2019t it, that\u2019s why there\u2019s the OFFLINE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN CAUSE now. When they do see her, they don\u2019t take her serious and think she\u2019s exaggerating. We need to have her have what she needs to get out of Africa and be allowed to live somewhere else in the states or Canada or anywhere that is not full of Hate on ever corner. \n\nJune Mayema is the sweetest thing you've seen & doesn\u2019t deserve what she is going through, she needs money every month so give when you can and it will be so so so appreciated. For those who would be able to afford a quick $50.00 to help June, and you prefer Paypal for a quick deposit donation directly and not through any other site, you can go here: http://bit.ly/giveMayema and thank you for the Love.  And to all, than you for everything you\u2019ve done, you\u2019re doing, and you will do, to help us help June. xox\n\nIn Perfect Love\nAnd Perfect Trust\nYours Truly:\nAri R.
