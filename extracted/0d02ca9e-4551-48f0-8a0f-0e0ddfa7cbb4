Why?\n\nThis question merits an answer and I believe I have with the help of many researchers uncovered a devious plan to control the populace and make alot of money doing so.\n\nThe plan is elaborate and highly functional on so many levels. Many have their hands in the scheme and many are influencing the outcome.\n\nFact:\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control patent is on a strand of Ebola known as \u201CEboBun.\u201D It\u2019s patent No. CA2741523A1 is a combination of several strands and is extremely dangerous.\n(link to patent), but why?\n\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/CA2741523A1?cl=en\n\nThe patent belongs to The Government Of The United States Of America As Represented By The Secretary, Department Of Health &amp; Human Services, Center For Disease Control.\n\nThe patent summary says, \u201CThe invention provides the isolated human Ebola (hEbola) viruses denoted as Bundibugyo (EboBun) deposited with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201CCDC\u201D; Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America) on November 26, 2007 and accorded an accession number 200706291.\u201D\n\nIt goes on to state, \u201CThe present invention is based upon the isolation and identification of a new human Ebola virus species, EboBun. EboBun was isolated from the patients suffering from hemorrhagic fever in a recent outbreak in Uganda.\u201D (this strand was developed by our government)\n\nFurthermore, the Ebola make up,\nthe family Filoviridae consists of two genera, Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, which have likely evolved from a common ancestor\u2019. The genus Ebolavirus includes four species: Zaire, Sudan, Reston and Cote d\u2019Ivoire (Ivory Coast) ebolaviruses, which have, with the exception of Reston and Cote d\u2019Ivoire ebolaviruses, been associated with large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreaks in Africa with high case fatality (53-90%)\n\nInteresting to note that the above statement on the claim for the patent states \u201Cwhich have likely evolved from a common ancestor\u2019 The Ancestors being just about every Ebola virus out there and a deadly combination virus created by the US Government, the CDC and it\u2019s scientists.\u00A0\n\nThis is one powerfully virulent strand that our government owns. It is suitable to understand the intent of the CDC and that is continuing to resource and develop what could ultimately be the most powerful strain of Ebola out their being marketed under the nam EBLOA-BUN or Bundibugyo.\u00A0\n\nIt currently has a kill rate percentage of 53 to 90 percent within 5 days. Seems like it could really be some type of weapon of biological warfare. Note to self, the Marburg virus is from a German strand used in their arsenal of biological arms.\n\nCurrently and since 1967 the CDC, the US government have not had a large enough pool of Ebola patients to develop an all encompassing vaccine. The expense of developing a vaccine has not been worth the cost to develop it. So what is the next logical step? I would reduce from my observations of world events via a major uptick of chatter and events. The conclusion is that the CDC is needing a larger pool of sick Ebola patients. A huge assist from Bill and Melinda Gates was needed and has been proven as a catalyst to make it happen. This duo has donated multiple millions to develop a vaccine. The \u201Cwhy\u201D is evident by the actions of multi billionaires investing heavily with their money. This could appear as just an \u201Cinvestment\u201D in the safety of all people but Bill Gates historical comments about population control and his desire to see the worlds population at around 1 billion is suspect.\n\nSooo, we shout pandemic in Africa, we need a larger pool of sick Ebola patients, more laboratory rats. \u00A0We have to have an outbreak in the US with the tone being impending doom. Now you are scared! Now, you will act! What should scare you is this next quote from the US Patent office and the content displayed.\n\nThe Ebola patent and it\u2019s inventors filed in October 2009:\nPublication number:\nCA2741523 A1\nPublication type\tApplication\nApplication number\tCA 2741523\nPCT number\tPCT/US2009/062079\nPublication date\tApr 29, 2010\nFiling date\t\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Oct 26, 2009\nPriority date\tOct 24, 2008\nAlso published as\tEP2350270A2\n\nInventors\nJonathan S. Towner\nApplicant-Jonathan S. Townes and 4 others\n\nNext question&#160;! Why have American Ebola victims been brought to the United States in the first place.\n\nRemember that since 1967 we have known of Eboli and it\u2019s devastating effects on a body if infected with it.\u00A0\n\nThe Ebola virus has been primarily non active for many years and showing no significant growth or movement till 2014. Until recently Ebola has been killing on average 40 people a year since 1967. The virus in it\u2019s past form,believe it or not, has been fairly difficult to spread and replicate. Deadly, but slow to progress\u2026\u2026..until now.\n\nLet\u2019s explore some things we know about EBOLA and its relationship with the CDC.\n\nThe CDC\n1) Extracts Ebola viruses from patients and creates a deadly multi strain virus from several regions.\n\n2) Invented the Ebola-B virus with it\u2019s multiple strands into one dangerous strand capable of killing many.\n\n3) Files for monopoly patent protection on the virus.\n\n4) Claims intellectual property rights on it by bringing Dr Brantley and his Nurse to Atlanta Georgia for treatment.\n\n5) Has received millions from Bill and Melinda Gates to fast track a vaccine that will make them multiple tens of billions of dollars.\n\n6) Tekmira stock value moves upward recently. Tekmira is the maker of an Ebola Vaccine using the CDCs multi pronged all encompassing strand of Eboli. Although Monsanto denies it, they have joined with Tekmira for future developments, not vaccine production.\n\n7) Has filed for sole commercialization rights to their vaccine, their invention.\nUnderstand this, a\u00A0patent defined is a government-enforced monopoly on a certain product, in this case, EBOLA. The CDC and the US Government using its vested partners recieve total profit on the sale of any product they patent, given exclusive rights to it that no one else can use or monopolize upon.\n\n8) We need population control, Bill Gates says so!\n\nBut why?\nWhy would anyone or any entity benefit from a patented disease?\n\nIt\u2019s mostly about money.\u00A0\n\nThe second possibility is to form biological weapons for dispersion to totally annihilate the opposition.\n\nThirdly, it\u2019s about control of a population with forced vaccines and quarantine of American citizens. 70 percent of Africa is quarantined at this time. Perhaps 3,000 troops sent to Africa are sent there to find out how to do it in the United States.\n\nNext, it\u2019s a stretch but it seems like a great time to get a big dose of martial law to delay the November 2016 elections and control the populace\n\nLastly, the Military Industrial Complex has to have a war machine pumping at full force. The president speaking at the UN on September 24th, 2014 discussed 4 major talking points. The support of Syria, the fight with ISIS, Russia and it\u2019s invasions and EBOLA all contained in the same little speech. Sounds curiously like a global event is on our horizon.\n\nNot buying it? Lets look further.\nIn summary the US Government states in The \u201CSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\u201D the \u00A0U.S. government is claiming \u201Cownership\u201D over all future Ebola viruses that shares 70% similarity with the Ebola Filoviridae, \u00A0it \u201Cinvented\u201D:\n\nThe patent further explains, this is gonna knock your socks off.\n\n1. In another aspect, the invention provides the complete (The entire culmination of strands)\u00A0genomic sequence of the hEbola virus EboBun.\n\nThe ability to create Ebola vaccines and propagation of the virus.\n\nIn case you were wondering propagation means:\n\nprop\u00B7a\u00B7gate (verb form)\n\n1. To cause (an organism) to multiply or breed.\n2. To breed\n3. To transmit from one generation to another.\n4. To cause to extend to a broader area or larger venue, to spread\n5. To have offspring; multiply.\n6. To extend to a broader area or larger number; spread.\n7. To move through a medium.\n\nThe CDC patent goes on to explain it specifically claims patent protection on a method for PROPAGATING THE EBOLA VIRUS IN HOST CELLS as well as treating infected hosts with vaccines:\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for propagating the hEbola virus in host cells comprising infecting the host cells with the inventive isolated hEbola virus described above, culturing the host cells to allow the virus to multiply, and harvesting the resulting virions. In other words and very simplified, the CDC has the right to inject humans via their cells to obtain the genus of the strain to create vaccines and inject them with \u00A0it! The molecular propagation process may allow\u00A0singular activity of propagation but the process can and will involve live hosts to nurture the virus.\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides vaccine preparations, comprising the inventive hEbola virus, including recombinant and chimeric forms of the virus, nucleic acid molecules comprised by the virus, or protein subunits of the virus. The invention also provides a vaccine formulation comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the inventive hEbola virus described above, and a pharmaceutically ACCEPTABLE CARRIER.\n\n\u201CA host cell usually is the name given to one cell that was infected by a virus or a bacteria\u2026 It becomes the host cell of that virus or bacteria, and the cell/whole organism may become ill.\u201D\n\n\u201CIn that condition the \u201Cguest\u201D, pathogens, obtains nourishment from the host and also effective conditions for reproduction and growing. But also the host protects itself evolving defenses and resistence to further invasions. The study of host cell \u2013 pathogens interactions is very important and helps the scientists to discover medicines to fight the diseases caused by the pathogens invasion.\u201D\n\nThis patent may help explain why Ebola victims are being transported to the United States and put under the medical authority of the CDC. These patients are carrying valuable intellectual property assets in the form of Ebola variants, and the Centers for Disease Control clearly desires to expand its patent portfolio by harvesting, studying and potentially patenting new strains or variants.\n\nNext question. Why did we bring a fairly healthy Doctor and his nurse to Atlanta Ga?\n\nDr. Bob Arnot, an infectious disease specialist with experience on the ground treating Ebola patients told Judge Jeanine recently \u201CThere is no medical reason to bring them here, especially when you see how well Dr. Brantley was.\u201D\n\nThere is, however, an entirely different reason to bring Ebola patients to America: so they can be exploited for medical experiments, military bioweapons harvesting or intellectual property claims.\n\nEmory University, the CDC are gathering all this information for a reason. The deliberate and intentional steps are glaring. The most recent addition of Ebola patients injected into the US and the scare that will surely follow is the biggest heist of our time and it\u2019s happening virtually before our eyes. You knew it would happen. They have been warning us since January. It had to happen. \u201COne plane flight away\u201D , \u201Ca patient may just walk in to a hospital.\u201D Remember, the EBOLA virus has been around for nearly 40 years and NO supposed reported cases\u2026till now! This is statistically suspicious.\u00A0\n\nThe isolating, identifying and patenting infectious disease agents is being done for a reason. The reasons I believe have been discussed in this venue.\n\nThe focus now is to scare people enough for them to start asking for and demanding a vaccine to protect us, in fact, people are already starting to ask and demand a vaccine. It\u2019s coming, watch for it.\n\nIn the coming weeks we will see the fear spread from city to city. One outbreak after another. It\u2019s all coming together.\n\nA global disease that got out of hand. The disease created by the government and overseen by the CDC giving all they got to generate enough money so that other agendas can be assured.\n\nThe rise of pharmaceutical stock, wealth of multi billionaires like Bill Gates expanded, a government quarantine, a world wide war, escape of ebola accidentally from a lab,the almost instant development of a viable multivalent vaccine, the CDC and the president saves the world with his awesome leadership, an outbreak, martial law envoked and a president for life. And the shift to third\u00A0World status with dictatorial reign is accomplished! \u00A0The socialist shift perfected.\n\nInterestingly enough the CDC mysteriously says that no more of the wonder drug ZMAPP that got Dr Brantley cured is no longer available, go figure, but may be available in the future.\n\nAnd did I mention, George Soros is building hospitals and clinics with hundreds of millions of dollars of government money\u2026..oh well another blog entry at another time.\n\nSource of some very good info: wake up slaves","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"id":"140774814_150090986_99503867838","activity":"Likes","created_at":"Thu, 09 Oct 2014 00:50:57 +0000","source":{"blogid":"140774814"},"dest":{"blogid":"150090986","postid":"99503867838"},"root":{"blogid":"150090986","postid":"99503867838"},"parent":{"blogid":"0","postid":"0"},"meta":{"url":"http://wakeupslaves.tumblr.com/post/99503867838/ebola-the-reasons-behind-an-american-outbreak-may","type":"photo","description":"Ebola: The reasons behind an American outbreak may surprise you!\n (everyone but black people, we are not surprised )\n\n\n\nThe CDC and our US Government owns the patent to Ebola-B and all future strands, has full commercial rights to vaccine production and owns the intellectual property rights.\n\nQuestion?
