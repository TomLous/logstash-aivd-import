But he crossed a line when he started comparing Ben Carson to a child molester (need I explain why we shouldn?t compare people to things such as a child molester, and how that normalizes such behavior- not only joking but literally, too?).A guy on Twitter started making threats to kill children and Jews, and defied a judge?s orders to stop.Because of the terrorist attacks in Paris, different locations and cities in Washington D.C., New York, and Massachusetts have upped the amount of police on duty, and the LAPD has, too.On the Marist campus, there was a lockdown because of a threat a 16-year-old boy made.The German football team revealed that just hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, they had to evacuate the hotel they were staying in, in Paris, because of a bomb threat.*EDIT* Cities with terrorist warnings: New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Las Vegas, London, Rome, and Toronto.*EDIT* On top of all of this, Islamophobes have started attacking Muslims. Please know that most Muslims do not agree with ISIS and are not part of it. Do not send hate to Muslims. Do not blame the acts of ISIS on those who partake in Islamic practices. ISIS? Muslim.*EDIT* A tour bus crashed in San Francisco Union Square and 20 were injured (at least 5 of them had life-threatening injuries).*EDIT* Anaheim?Lowe?s was evacuated because a package looked like a pipe bomb.With all that has been going on in the world- TODAY ALONE- it is quite scary.\nSo please, if you?re someone who prays, pray for the people that have been harmed, killed, maimed, threatened, physically or mentally hurt, or have feared for their life.\nAnd no matter what you believe in, PLEASE find websites to make donations to and organizations to help these people in need.\nIf anyone has any links to make donations, knows anyone that has truly been affected by any of these things (if you?d like to share a link that they?d be fine with having shared, so that people can send them love, that would be great), or knows of any phone numbers to help the people that are in these crises because of any of these things, please reblog this and comment them.\nI want as many people to feel safe and loved as possible. Anyone who has been threatened by these things or knows somebody going through any of these things, or whatever else, I want you to know that I (along with so many others) am here for you. My blog is a safe and hate-free zone. Please be careful!!\nPlease check out this link for where you can donate and how you can help. They will edit it if they find anymore links to help.\nGalacticsouls messaged me this:??Hey, talking about Ayotzinapa (Mexico) wouldn?t hurt anybody, you know? Earthquakes are not any big deal here but the massive corruption going on? Just look up for #Faltan43 and #2deOctubre. It would be really helpful if you spread this.?\n*If anyone has any links to donate to or to help people (or phone numbers), you can either reblog it and I?ll link your comment or you can message me and I?ll add your message to this, with a link to your blog.\nIf you have any more unfortunate happenings from today, I will just add them to (seemingly?ever-growing) list.\nAnd if anything is false, please correct me and let me know!
