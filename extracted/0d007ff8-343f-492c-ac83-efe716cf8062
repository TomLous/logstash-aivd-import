The city has been almost completely cut off from the other terrorist positions in the oblast by Ukrainian forces.  They expect the city to be completely surrounded within 24 hrs.  Parts of the city have already been taken back under Ukrainian control.

Others are trying to threaten locals into joining.  \n\n- A column of refugees traveling out of the conflict zone was fired on by terrorists on Monday, though they were traveling under white flags and through the humanitarian corridor meant to provide safe passage for refugees.  Dozens are dead, including women and children.\n\n- One of the terrorist leaders (and a Russian special forces agent) Strelkov was seriously wounded late last week.\n\nUKRAINE AND INTERNATIONAL:\n\n- Many of the trucks in Putin's \"humanitarian aid\" convoy turned out to be mostly empty.  It's still not entirely clear what kind of game he's hoping to play with them, but they have still not been allowed into Ukraine.  However, Moscow has taken to saying that they Ukrainian armed forces will try to blow them up.  Of course, the territory they plan to go into is controlled by terrorists, so if anyone blew them up\u2026  Second, it's not far fetched that the trucks are empty because Moscow is planning to see them blown up in the first place (why waste all that non-existent humanitarian aid?)  Which, of course, one could expect them to use as a pretext for full-scale invasion.  At the same time, \"helpful\" Russian artillery continues to fire across the border to support the terrorists.  That Putin is such a humanitarian\u2026\n\n- Negotiations were held in Berlin on Sunday night between Foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.  During this meeting, supposedly Russia consented to the demands of the int'l community concerning its \"humanitarian aid\".  The OSCE is to inspect all the cargo in the next couple of days.  \n\n- The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) with it's newly appointed leader has called for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine and said that the conflict in the east of Ukraine is NOT civil war (as Russia tries to spin it) but an international conflict between 2 states.  This is pleasantly surprising news, as some had considered that the new head might be more pro-Moscow.\n\n- Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs has called on NATO and the EU to give direct military aid to Ukraine.  Germany has stated that it does not have any plans to do so at this point.   \n\n\"Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies;\nIn You I take shelter.\" - Ps. 143:9", "source": "Status (25554907596)", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/757775320_10154471552090321", "subtype": "link", "received_at": 1408376079.8405, "type": "facebook", "id": "1e426ed1dfa3a900e066ead59e5f8b8c", "tags": ["tab5"], "schema": {"version": 3}}, "language": {"confidence": 99, "tag": "en", "tag_extended": "en"}, "links": {"code": [200], "title": ["Update Your Browser | Facebook"], "hops": [["https://www.facebook.com/benjamindmorrison/posts/10153127909513136"]], "created_at": ["Mon, 18 Aug 2014 15:28:27 +0000"], "url": ["https://www.facebook.com/unsupportedbrowser"], "meta": {"lang": ["en"], "charset": ["CP1252"]}, "normalized_url": ["https://facebook.com/unsupportedbrowser"]}, "enrich": {"facebook": [{"username": "jsterlingbrown", "first_name": "Joel", "last_name": "Brown", "middle_name": "Sterling", "name": "Joel Sterling Brown", "locale": "en_US", "gender": "male", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/jsterlingbrown", "id": "757775320"}]}, "demographic": {"gender": "male"}, "facebook": {"picture": "https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xap1/t1.0-1/p100x100/7742_10152589374798136_244436848_n.jpg", "description": "PRAY FOR UKRAINE!!!\nUPDATE ON AUG. 18TH\n\nEAST:\n\n- In Lugansk, some terrorists are already taking down their \"Lugansk People's Republic\" flags.
