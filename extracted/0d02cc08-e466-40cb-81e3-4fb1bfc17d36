Multiple threats from all angles and just like the characters in the show, we either don't know these threats or we do know but choose to ignore them. We've been always taught that knowing your history, prevents you from repeating it. Knowing alone doesn't stop it from repeating, active movements dedicated to preventing the repetition is what helps. Let's begin from outside and make our way inside. First, Eurasia: Ukraine... Looks like a new cold war is somewhat started between Russia and the US, with Putin and Obama sizing up each other. Will we make the mistake and turn this one into an actual Hot War? Not yet, might take looks 2-3 more huge events to ignite, not including Syria. \n\nNext, we move to the middle east: ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria)... Seems like we have been fighting in that area for generations. Back in the 10th century we called it the Holy War or the crusades and after that period the issue became dormant for a while. It was slowly building up from the 80s (maybe earlier) but was ignited on September 11, 2001 (Remember... Remember the 11th of September) and we changed the name of this war to \"The War of Terror.\" We went back in to the area to destroy \"terror.\" I remember thinking how can the physical fight the non physical? How can a person fight an ideology or a state of mind? Have u ever tried convincing someone who is stubborn in their ways? End result, we created terror on their side for years, from overzealous military recruits that shot down innocents because \"It was like a game of Call of Duty with the air strikes\" (and of course we tried to cover it up from the public). So let me ask a question: What would happen if someone killed your kin? Result, I would F@#K them up anyway possible. In these case they choose public beheadings and the \"War on Terror\" continues. \n\nWhile all this is going on, African are killing other Africans but I guess mother nature thought it would be fun to get involved. She set loose HIV/AIDS, and now Ebola which has taking 2700 lives in just 2-3 months. It has knocked on our door but we have extreme precautions in our sterile society that works hard to protect us. But I wonder what would happen if it did get through. How weak are our immune systems when we never give it a chance to fight and get stronger. We sometimes go to the doctor to get antibiotics (Anti-Bacteria) to treat a simple cold (usually virus).\n\nNow, we can look within our great country. We have the recession (which is not over regardless of what's said). We have increasing debt, as individuals and as a country but as individuals we HAVE to have that new gadget (it's the new and shiny). As a country, we have to be the \"anchor of the world,\" so we have to borrow in order to fighter terror or injustice wherever it maybe. We look outside and point to other nations and tell them \"YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG\" while we as a nation are still fighting racism, classism, sexism and religious discrimination (THESE ARE THE SAME THINGS WE SAY THEY ARE DOING WRONG).\n\nAll these issues (except for the viruses in Africa) are multifactorial in origin. It might stem from the human need to be different than the next. Each time we meet a strange (male or female) our subconscious has already started to analyze them, looking for what makes them different from us.... should i be threatened by them or am I better than him/her (Stronger, smarter, better dressed etc.. I would advice killing that thought process when u discover it creeping up). It's gotten bad enough that we easily analyze with external features without TALKING to the person and usually we use skin to do so. And of course we use WHITE as the benchmark. Some ppl think that the brown paper bag test happens only among African American and they are  absolutely wrong. Discrimination within ones own race occurs with all races. I remember asking a Korean friend to come out to the beach with some other friends. She said to me \"I can't get darker.\" I was like \"WHAT? You are WHITE as in pale.\" But apparently, the lighter you are in Asian culture, the easier it is for you to move up social ladder as well as find a spouse. SOUND FAMILIAR BLACK PPL? We are all inherently biased towards white over black, we praise the day and have disdain for the night. Imagine walking down a dark ally alone and hearing footsteps. You see a shadow and it turns out to be a caucasian gentleman. After your subconscious has analyzed him, what would be your stance? Now imagine he is the darkest African American...", "subtype": "status", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/782787245_10152728344877246", "source": "web", "received_at": 1411392581.5905, "type": "facebook", "id": "1e4425c7678aa500e066578b7b9368b0", "tags": ["tab7"], "schema": {"version": 3}}, "facebook": {"author": {"link": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=782787245", "type": "user", "name": "Ugo Aghazu", "avatar": "https://graph.facebook.com/782787245/picture", "id": "782787245"}, "created_at": "Mon, 22 Sep 2014 13:29:22 +0000", "is_share": false, "source": "web", "message": "Woke up with the impression that our lives seem to have been scripted by the writers of Game of Thrones.
