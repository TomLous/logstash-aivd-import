In the same way, a hard core spouse will not respond to counseling, dialogue or love. A hard core child could be a rebellious kid who refuses to change despite undergoing hardship, threats, jail or suffering. It is difficult to deal with a hard core person.\n\nThere are also people with a hard core mental stance. They may decide for example that they cannot and will not give up an extra marital relationship.\n\nHow do people become hard core?\n\nOne of the symbols of the Word of God is water, and one quality of water is, it makes things soft and malleable. Without the constant application of the water of God’s Word, you can dry up and become a hard core person.\n\nHebrews 3:13 states, “Exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”\n\nTo prevent hardness, we must be exhorted or sprinkled with the water of God's Word daily, otherwise sin will harden us!\n\nKakra Baiden","id":"1439365009630518_1621397698093914","is_share":false,"link":"https://www.facebook.com/kakrabaiden/photos/a.126627963599.103001.78329223599/10152972053603600/?type=1","name":"Prophet Kakra Baiden","picture":"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/10929067_10152972053603600_2409107147647615096_n.jpg?oh=0838ccfdc01b1c9186db2bb9519c3a29&oe=55AB46AA&__gda__=1433917372_7996867174881f3814ef8513b93eb3b9","source":"web","story":"Mt.
