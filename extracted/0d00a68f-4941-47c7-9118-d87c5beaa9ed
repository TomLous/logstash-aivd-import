Video beheadings, public executions, and torture have come to characterize life under the Islamic State in Western media. The Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, quickly imposed strict sharia, banned political parties and \"killed indiscriminately\" during their rise to power after establishing control in Kandahar, Afghanistan in 1994, according to Slate. As a result, thousands of members of religious minorities were killed during the five-year rule of the Taliban, according to Oxfam."],"keywords":[["middle-east","actualité","cyberpress"]],"lang":["en"]},"normalized_url":["http://cyber-actu.com/isis-reportedly-kills-13-boys-watching-soccer-isis-214944545"],"title":["Cyber-Actualité | ISIS reportedly kills 13 boys for watching soccer: Is ISIS adopting Taliban tactics?"],"url":["http://cyber-actu.com/isis-reportedly-kills-13-boys-watching-soccer-isis-214944545"]},"twitter":{"created_at":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 22:01:26 +0000","display_urls":["cyber-actu.com/isis-reportedl…"],"domains":["cyber-actu.com"],"filter_level":"low","id":"557659189481594881","lang":"en","links":["http://cyber-actu.com/isis-reportedly-kills-13-boys-watching-soccer-isis-214944545"],"source":"<a href=\"http://cyber-actu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">CyberNewsUK</a>","text":"http://t.co/Hwna2l9Heg Christian Science Monitor: ISIS reportedly kills 13 boys for watching soccer: Is ISIS adopting Taliban tactics?","user":{"created_at":"Mon, 08 Sep 2014 10:01:06 +0000","favourites_count":0,"followers_count":100,"friends_count":2,"geo_enabled":false,"id":2797652929,"id_str":"2797652929","lang":"en","listed_count":10,"name":"CyberNewsUK","profile_image_url":"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/508918449578319874/L9rglBIZ_normal.png","profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/508918449578319874/L9rglBIZ_normal.png","screen_name":"CyberNewsUK","statuses_count":100035,"time_zone":"Ljubljana","utc_offset":3600,"verified":false}}}
