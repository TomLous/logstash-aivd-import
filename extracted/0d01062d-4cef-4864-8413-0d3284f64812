A broad truce was agreed upon in early September after all-party talks in Belarus, but hundreds have been killed since then amid daily violations.\nOn Monday, a deal was reached to end fighting over the airport in the capital of the Donetsk region, but rocket barrages continued for hours in that area all the same.\nThere are concerns that any efforts to impose a cease-fire in the Luhansk region could be derailed by infighting among separatist forces.\nAlthough rebel areas are nominally under the control of the self-styled Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, much of the territory is in fact presided over by Russian Cossacks, who have frequently demonstratively rejected Plotnitsky\u2019s authority.\nThere have been multiple unconfirmed media reports in recent days of fatal clashes between fighters of the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic and Cossack units.\nThe OSCE said in its report Monday, however, that the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic insists it is in control of all Cossack units.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/1vb0j74","created_at":"Tue, 02 Dec 2014 11:36:01 +0000","id":"1e47a176416aa6808c2a9c18e92cca75","link":"http://timetopstories.tumblr.com/post/104152733499/ukraine-government-rebels-agree-on-new-cease-fire","media_type":"text","received_at":1417520161.8989000,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","title":"Ukraine Government, Rebels Agree on New Cease-Fire","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab5"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"links":{"code":[200],"created_at":["Tue, 02 Dec 2014 11:19:04 +0000"],"hops":[["http://ift.tt/1vb0j74","http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/EkKXmk7tV-8/","http://time.com/3613370/ukraine-government-rebels-agree-on-new-cease-fire/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+time%2Ftopstories+%28TIME%3A+Top+Stories%29"]],"meta":{"charset":["UTF-8"],"description":["Under the agreement, hostilities are to cease Friday"],"keywords":[["ukraine","rebels","russia","luhansk people's republic","osce"]],"lang":["unknown"],"opengraph":[{"description":"Under the agreement, hostilities are to cease Friday","facebook_publisher":"https://www.facebook.com/time","image":"http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png?m=1391184390g","site_name":"TIME.com","title":"Ukraine Government, Rebels Agree on New Cease-Fire","type":"article","url":"http://time.com/3613370/ukraine-government-rebels-agree-on-new-cease-fire/"}],"twitter":[{"card":"summary_large_image","description":"Under the agreement, hostilities are to cease Friday","site":"TIME","title":"Ukraine Government, Rebels Agree on New Cease-Fire"}]},"normalized_url":["http://time.com/3613370/ukraine-government-rebels-agree-on-new-cease-fire"],"title":["Ukraine Government, Rebels Agree on New Cease-Fire"],"url":["http://time.com/3613370/ukraine-government-rebels-agree-on-new-cease-fire/"]},"tumblr":{"activity":"CreatePost","blog_name":"timetopstories","blogid":"162299999","body":"<p>(KIEV, Ukraine) \u2014 Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed separatist forces in the Luhansk region have agreed on a new cease-fire, international monitors said.</p>\n<p>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that under the agreement, hostilities are to cease Friday along the line of contact between the warring sides.</p>\n<p>It was agreed at negotiations that took place Saturday that heavy weapons will start being withdrawn from the front at the weekend, the OSCE said in its daily update report Monday evening.</p>\n<p>Igor Plotnitsky, the head of the rebel movement in Luhansk, confirmed the cease-fire deal in remarks to Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency, but said no definitive agreement had been reached on the breadth of the demilitarized zone.</p>\n<p>He told Interfax the distance could range between 15 and 20 kilometers (10 and 13 miles).</p>\n<p>Cease-fire deals have been reached before in eastern Ukraine, only to be swiftly violated.
