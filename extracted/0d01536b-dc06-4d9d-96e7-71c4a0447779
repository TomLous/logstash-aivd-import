He is not American so most of you don’t care and probably never heard about him. This is Tomislav Salopek.\nHe was from Croatia. He was 31 and had a wife and two kids. He was working for a french company CGG in Kairo, Egypt. Yesterday he was executed by isis.\nI personally didn’t know him but after everything that has happend over the last few days I feel so sad to hear he was so brutally murdered. He did nothing wrong. He was completely innocent. He was abducted while he was going to work on August 22nd.\nIf he were American this whole site would be full of prayers and posts about him. But he’s not. Still he shouldn’t be forgotten just because he’s not from US.\nR.I.P. Tomislav, you will always be in our prayers. Not only you, but also your family.\n","created_at":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 13:53:34 +0000","id":"1e541c2b02f0a300820ecdb09f6c8375","link":"http://haliloviceva.tumblr.com/post/126549572603","received_at":1439474015.8095000,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"like","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"like","blog":{"id":"231930521","name":"pricam-ti-o-njemu","url":"http://pricam-ti-o-njemu.tumblr.com/"},"blog_name":"pricam-ti-o-njemu","blogid":"231930521","created_at":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 13:53:34 +0000","id":"00051d31a94afe7e2984560ee896f083","meta":{"content":"I suppose most of you don’t know who the man on the photo is.
