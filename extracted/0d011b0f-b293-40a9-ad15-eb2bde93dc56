I doesn?t really matter.\nThis is my first post after the attacks in Paris. I was in the Bataclan venue for the Eagles Of Death Metal show. I managed to hide backstage with a group of 25, maybe 30 people. We locked ourselves and tried to stay as quiet as possible. The terrorists were in the room right next to us. We stayed there for more than two hours until the police launched their final assault, then they took us out. \nI?m so, so lucky. I?m alive and I?m not even harmed. I?m not writing this for you people to feel sorry or anything. I?m alright.\nI just wanted to say this : stop being negative, stop fighting each other. Please. The only people to fight against are ISIS. But we, people, must unite. It?s NOT the Muslims? fault. It?s NOT the refugees? fault. It?s NOT a competition to know which city in the world is the most devastated. It?s a war taking place in many different places and in many different ways. \nUNITE against ISIS. Division is exactly what they want. They need to be stopped. And I think we all want the same thing : peace. \nMaybe something started on Nov 13th. Some people are going to fight, physically, most likely in Syria, where ISIS is settled. Maybe more people will die. But this is probably the only option? \nAll I know is that you, reading me right now, have to spread peace, love, and positive vibes as much as possible. Tell your close ones you love them. Keep going to shows, movie theaters, museums. And for fuck?s sake stop dividing.\nOh, and one last thing. PLEASE stop sharing all those pictures and videos of the venue during and after the shooting. I?ve seen those bodies, I?ve stepped in this blood. And I don?t want to go through this again. Respect, please.\n","created_at":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 21:56:33 +0000","id":"1e58e3f3b153ae80845482af6f28a675","link":"http://tqol.tumblr.com/post/133304039542","received_at":1447883795.3826001,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"like","title":"So I survived the Bataclan attack in Paris ","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"like","blog":{"id":"162261338","name":"genderfluxdipper","url":"http://genderfluxdipper.tumblr.com/"},"blog_name":"the-awesomest-pancakes","blogid":"162261338","created_at":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 21:56:33 +0000","id":"000524d7b735a3e9a8280590065f12bb","meta":{"content":"Hello everyone.\nI don?t know how many people are going to read this.
