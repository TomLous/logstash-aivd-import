We are not at war with them, but they most assuredly are at war with us.\n\u201cAirstrikes in Iraq: What You Need to Know,\u201d by Ben Rhodes,White House Blog, August 11, 2014 (thanks to Jerk Chicken):\nPresident Obama has authorized the U.S. military to execute targeted airstrikes in Iraq.\nThe President takes no decision more seriously than the use of military force. So it\u2019s worth taking a few minutes to make sure you understand exactly what is happening in Iraq right now, who is involved, and why we are taking action. Here are a few answers to some key questions Americans may be asking:\u2026\n7. Is ISIL more dangerous than al-Qaeda right now?\nWhile both are terrorist forces, they have different ambitions. Al-Qaeda\u2019s principal ambition is to launch attacks against the west and U.S. homeland. That\u2019s the direct threat that we have taken direct action against for many years. Right now, ISIL\u2019s primary focus is consolidating territory in the Middle East region to establish their own Islamic State. So they\u2019re different organizations with different objectives.\n8. Are we at war with ISIL? Will we be sending troops back to Iraq?\nNo. There is no U.S. military solution to the larger situation in Iraq. The United States\u2019 chief goals are to protect our personnel and facilities, and to prevent a potential act of genocide. That is the scope of these operations. As the President said, we will support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, but no American combat troops will be returning to fight in Iraq.\n9. What\u2019s our plan moving forward?\nWe will protect our citizens, and we will work with Iraqis and the international community to address the humanitarian crisis facing the Yezidi people.\nAs we carry out that mission, we will pursue a strategy that empowers Iraqi leaders to come together, forge an inclusive government, and build security forces that can fight back against threats like ISIL. The Iraqi people have named a new President, a new Speaker of Parliament, and a new Prime Minister\u2013an important step towards forming a government that can unite communities in Iraq. The U.S. will work with this new government and other countries in the region on a broader counterterrorism strategy moving forward.", "subtype": "status", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/110714605633989_761934267178683", "source": "web", "received_at": 1407963915.7696, "mentions": ["Judea and Samaria- The Land of G-d"], "type": "facebook", "id": "1e4232d7a480ac00e066655cef345108", "schema": {"version": 3}}, "facebook": {"to": {"names": ["Judea and Samaria- The Land of G-d"], "ids": ["110714605633989"]}, "author": {"link": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=637871093", "type": "user", "name": "Judy Shapiro", "avatar": "https://graph.facebook.com/637871093/picture", "id": "637871093"}, "created_at": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 21:04:56 +0000", "is_share": false, "source": "web", "message": "WHITE HOUSE: US NOT At WAR With islamic State\nMY DEAR FRIENDS:\nSON-OF-ISLAM obama has ZERO credentials \nor successes in Foreign Policy after almost 7 \nunbearably long years.\nHe was and still is naive, and constantly favors\nmuslim-populated NOT democratic entities. \nHe felt and still feels 'right at home' with some \nof the most egregious dictators who are\nobedient followers of predator mohammed.\nHowever, NARCISSIST that obama is, he only \nsurrounds with yes-women and yes-men \nas he continues to castrate the US military \nrepeatedly.\nHis 'Red Line' for Syria brought his serial-lying \nto a new low.\nRussian KGBer Putin has bested him \nrepeatedly, and today the US has no real \nALLIES in the EU (European Union).\nHis treatment of my ISRAEL is a disgrace despite\napologist SELF-LOATHING NY Times tom \nfriedman's et als non-stop propaganda.\nHis minimalizing the real threat to the US \nby the barbaric muslim ISIS should give \nus all pause to be aware of the dire\nconsequences.\nIt is further proof of his incompetence.\nWAKE UP!!\nI TOLD YOU!!\nAM YISROEL CHAI\nISRAEL=JEWISH\nNO MORE CARVING ISRAEL UP OR PRISONER \nRELEASES\nSILENCE=COMPLICITY\nSTAY INFORMED\nSTAY VIGILANT\nTHE TINY YET POWERFUL ISRAEL IS, \nWILL, AND MUST ALWAYS PREVAIL\nJERUSALEM IS THE UNDIVIDED ETERNAL \nCAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND THE JEWISH \nPEOPLE\nKING SOLOMON\n'IF YOU SAVE ONE, IT IS LIKE SAVING THE\nWORLD'\ntheir state=TransJordan\nNO MOSQUE AT GROUND ZERO\nWHAT ABOUT BENGHAZIGATE?\nWHAT ABOUT DANIEL PEARL's muslim\nMURDERERS?\nFREE JONATHAN POLLARD\nJUDY\nNEVER AGAIN\nNEVER FORGET\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nWHITE HOUSE: US Not At WAR With islamic State\nBy Robert Spencer-JIHAD WATCH\nAugust 13, 2014\n\u201cRight now, ISIL\u2019s primary focus is consolidating territory in the Middle East region to establish their own Islamic State.\u201d Yecienciess, but they have made it abundantly clear that that is not their only goal, and that they desire ultimately to strike inside the United States.
