To add to it, the global stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride over the past few weeks largely attributed to the downturn in China as well as a baffled outlook regarding the timing of the U.S. interest rate hike. \n? \nIn spite of uncertainties, the U.S. defense sector has held up well given the elevated geopolitical risk, a recovering U.S. economy and strong commercial sales. This appears to be fueling support in Washington for an increase in fiscal 2016 defense spending above sequestration caps. Although the effects of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen on the sector are too early to predict, its victory or failure might have implications for the industry, mainly for high-end weapon buy. The possibility of a Russian offensive in Ukraine and rising threat from the Islamic State (IS) may also help to build a more positive sentiment for the major contractors. \n? \nMeanwhile, the Congress is headlong into a stirring debate over the nuclear agreement with Iran as it returned from its August recess last week. Obama signed a law in May that gave Congress a 60-day window, ending Sep 17, to vote on the nuclear agreement between the U.S., five other world powers and Tehran. \n? \nAn Iran nuclear deal could mean a new arms race in the Middle East along with better relations between historic enemies. However, some argue that if Iran is freed from economic sanctions and the arms embargo, the IS group may prove to be even more assertive. Apart from the ISIS and Syrian conflict, continued saber-rattling by the North Korean leadership and high tensions over the disputed ownership of islands in the East and South China Sea are some of the ongoing global flashpoints. Ironically, wars and regional tensions have always proved to be a boon for the defense sector (read: 4 ETFs in Focus As Iran Reaches Nuclear Deal ). \n? \nThe defense sector also had an impressive second quarter with earnings as well as revenue beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 77.8% and 55.6%, respectively. A combination of cost cutting, share buybacks, mergers and acquisitions, restructuring as well as earnings gains from businesses outside the federal market helped to minimize investors? losses (read more: Aerospace & Defense Stock Outlook - Aug. 2015 ). \n? \nThe primary driver for these defense firms was the success they tasted in the ?rest of the world?. Countries allied with U.S. policy are spending a large chunk of their budget toward buying sophisticated artillery from the developed countries, particularly the U.S., to counter terrorist groups. Capitalizing on this opportunity, the big U.S. defense operators are expanding their operations through acquisitions and foreign orders, with foreign sales being a key revenue booster. In fiscal 2014, U.S. military sales to its allies were $34.2 billion, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. This marked a slight uptick from approximately $30 billion in fiscal 2013 sales (read more: Defense Firms Hunt for Alternatives on Lower Military Spend ). \n? \nHence, a politically unstable planet will ensure that the arms merchants are not out of business. That said, factors like a strong U.S. dollar and intense competition will continue to hurt results. The aerospace sector?s Q3 earnings are expected to decline 8% (read: Will Global Uncertainties, Strong Dollar Hurt Defense Stocks? ). \n? \n ETFs to Tap the Sector \n \nBelow, we have highlighted the aerospace and defense ETFs, which primarily have a U.S. bias. Investing in these funds in basket form greatly reduces the risk of investing in particular stocks. (See all industrials ETFs here ) \n \n iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ( ITA ) \n? \nWith a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), ITA has provided a return of 11.63% over the one-year period ended Jun 30, 2015.

The fund has an annual dividend yield of 1.10%. \n? \nThe ETF, launched in May 2006, presently has nearly $515.2 million in AUM and is heavily weighted toward the Industrials sector (97%) with the balance going to Technology. This fund holds 36 stocks with about 57.17% invested in the top 10 holdings. \n? \nAmong individual holdings, the top stocks in ITA include The Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and United Technologies Corp. comprising 8.37%, 7.46% and 7.09%, respectively, of total net assets. With a lilt toward large-cap companies, this fund charges investors 43 basis points a year. \n? \n Aerospace & Defense Profile ( PPA ) \n \nThis ETF tracks the SPADE Defense Index, holding 53 securities in its basket and has an expense ratio ? an annual fee ? of 0.66%. The Index is designed to identify a group of companies involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of U.S. defense, homeland security and aerospace operations. The index was launched in October 2005. \n? \nThis fund has a Zacks Rank #3 and is highly focused on U.S companies (100%). The fund so far has managed assets of $243.3 million with focus on large-cap companies. The top 10 companies hold a 55.33% share of total net assets. The average daily volume is about 43,103 shares and the fund has an annual dividend yield of 0.93%. \n? \nIn terms of holdings, Lockheed Martin Corp., Honeywell International Inc. and The Boeing Company occupy the top three positions in the basket comprising 7.35%, 6.48% and 6.41%, respectively, of total net assets. \n? \n SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF ( XAR ) \n? \nThis fund follows the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index, focusing on the aerospace and defense sector of the S&P Total Market Index. The Index is one of the 19 S&P Select Industry Indices, each designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries as defined by the Global Industry Classification Standards. \n? \nWith a Zacks ETF Rank #3, this fund charges investors just 35 basis points a year in fees for its exposure. Hence, it is considered the cheapest option in the aerospace and defense ETF market. \n? \nWith holdings of 34 stocks, the top spots are taken up by Lockheed Martin, Precision Castparts Corp. and TransDigm Group Incorporated comprising 4.82%, 4.19% and 4.10%, respectively, of total net assets. \n \nLaunched in September 2011, XAR has 100% focus on U.S companies. \n? \nThe fund has managed assets of $114 million so far and has an annual dividend yield of 0.88%. The top 10 companies hold a 40.21% share of total net assets. The average daily volume is about 30,618 shares. \n? \n To Sum Up \n? \nDespite global headwinds and the effect of sequestration, the defense biggies have been proactive in meeting evolving customer needs, particularly for affordable products, besides engaging in corporate restructuring. Moreover, tensions in Eastern Europe and demand for defense products in the Middle East and other Asian nations will ensure a steady inflow of foreign contracts. In this context, the above mentioned ETFs with favorable Zacks ETF Ranks might be a good idea to play defense. \n \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
