Ishtar, Diana, Astarte, Isis were all all called virgin, which did not refer to sexual chastity, but sexual independence. And all great culture heroes of the past, mythic or historic, were said to be born of virgin mothers: Marduk, Gilgamesh, Buddha, Osiris, Dionysus, Genghis Khan, Jesus - they were all affirmed as sons of the Great Mother, of the Original One, their worldly power deriving from her. When the Hebrews used the word, and in the original Aramaic, it meant ‘maiden’ or ‘young woman’, with no connotations to sexual chastity. But later Christian translators could not conceive of the ‘Virgin Mary’ as a woman of independent sexuality, needless to say; they distorted the meaning into sexually pure, chaste, never touched.","created_at":"Tue, 03 Feb 2015 18:25:02 +0000","hashtags":["politics","kind of","more","religion","but thats not  tag yet mh"],"id":"1e4abd1f7b05a3008b17f1a4da508a75","link":"http://thespongebobhippie.tumblr.com/post/109991496460/ancient-moon-priestesses-were-called-virgins","media_type":"quote","received_at":1422987903.2269001,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"activity":"CreatePost","blog_name":"thespongebobhippie","blogid":"80562756","created_at":"Tue, 03 Feb 2015 18:25:02 +0000","format":"html","id":"109991496460","meta":{"likes_global":0,"likes_local":0,"reblogged_global":7},"note_count":154277,"post_url":"http://thespongebobhippie.tumblr.com/post/109991496460/ancient-moon-priestesses-were-called-virgins","reblog_key":"ezcS8YGt","reblogged":{"from":{"id":"109976895518","name":"an-odd-ducky","title":"an odd ducky","url":"http://an-odd-ducky.tumblr.com/post/109976895518/ancient-moon-priestesses-were-called-virgins"},"root":{"id":"77166959840","name":"ynannarising","title":"Ynanna Rising","url":"http://ynannarising.tumblr.com/post/77166959840/ancient-moon-priestesses-were-called-virgins"}},"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZuRdot1cS0GiC","slug":"ancient-moon-priestesses-were-called-virgins","source_html":"<p>Monica Sjoo, The Great Cosmic Mother: Rediscovering the Religion of the Earth  (via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://thewaking.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">thewaking</a>)</p><p>Literally the most important thing you will read today.</p><p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://darvll.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">darvll</a>)</p>","source_title":"ynannarising","source_url":"http://ynannarising.tumblr.com/post/77166959840/ancient-moon-priestesses-were-called-virgins","state":"published","tags":["politics","kind of","more","religion","but thats not  tag yet mh"],"text":"Ancient moon priestesses were called virgins. ‘Virgin’ meant not married, not belonging to a man - a woman who was ‘one-in-herself’.
