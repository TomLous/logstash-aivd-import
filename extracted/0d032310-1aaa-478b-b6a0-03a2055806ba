It tells a story remarkably similar to events in Syria beginning in early 2011. Here is a montage of quotes from the document:\n\n\u201cIn early 1979, encouraged by the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood developed a plan to trigger a similar popular revolution in Syria to oust (Hafez) Assad. The massacre of 50 Alawite cadets, on 16 June 1979 at the Artillery School in Aleppo, signaled the start of the MB offensive.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian MB regroups for a \u201cnew round of fighting\u201d in late 1980, announces the formation of an \u201cIslamic Front\u201d\u2019 and increases cooperation with the Sunni (Baathist) government of Iraq which had helped the MB covertly in 1979-80 to oust Assad.\n\n\u201cThe plan, apparently developed by the leadership of the Syrian MB and probably coordinated with Iraq, centered on two complementary actions. The first was a full-scale revolt by the city of Hama, a traditional Brotherhood stronghold and the location of its covert headquarters in Syria. Once this rebellion was unleashed, similar uprisings were to take place in Aleppo, Damascus and other major cities, accompanied by a general strike designed to paralyze Syria...\u201d\n\n\u201cSimultaneously, a sophisticated worldwide propaganda campaign was to be launched supporting the rebellion and emphasizing its victories and the wholesale desertion of Army units to the rebel side. Press releases were to be made in Europe and the US, while propaganda broadcasts against Syria were to be carried by the Phalange-controlled Voice of Lebanon and the Iraqi-controlled Voice of Arab Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least 100 militants were transported from Jordan, where they had taken refuge, into Iraq where they probably received training prior to their movement into Syria... Sometime after this, the infiltration of \u2018Secret Apparatus\u2019 militants began from staging areas in Iraq, and to a lesser degree from Turkey, where others had fled. During the interim period, a number of terrorist bombings and shootings took place in Syria to demonstrate the Brotherhood/dissident Alawites ability to strike at the government.\u201d\n\nFree Syrian Army fighters launch a rocket towards Hama military airport that is controlled by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in the Hama countryside July 25, 2014.

(Reuters / Badi Khlif)\n\n\u201cAs a result of Syrian security actions, the MB was forced to prematurely unleash the Hama rebellion with the hope that it might spark widespread fighting in other cities\u2026The rebellion would also force the Damascus government to become even more oppressive. The Brotherhood leadership believed this would, in turn, cause greater alienation of the Assad government from the Sunni Muslim majority and within the Alawite community.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn February 2, following a clash between the MB and Syrian security forces, the loudspeakers atop the mosque minarets in Hama called on the people to begin a Jihad (Holy Struggle) against the government. The appeal also told the people that arms were available at specified mosques. At about the same time, teams of the MB\u2019s \u2018Secret Apparatus,\u2019 some in army uniforms, moved to attack preselected government targets in the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the propaganda reporting, the uprising in Syria had never spread outside of Hama, although some limited bombings had taken place in Damascus and elsewhere\u2026 The total casualties for the Hama incident probably number about 2,000. This includes an estimated 300-400 of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s elite \u2018Secret Apparatus\u2019\u2026 The Syrian dissidents\u2019 modus operandi will continue to be terrorism, particularly bombings and assassinations.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks: Syria\u2019s government and terrorism\nOn February 24, 2010, a Cable classified as \u2018Secret\u2019 was dispatched from the US Embassy in Damascus to the CIA, DIA, National Security Council, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Office of Homeland Security and a smattering of key US embassies in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nIt details the communications between Syria\u2019s General Intelligence Director (GID) Ali Mamlouk who dropped in on a meeting between Syria\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Faisal al-Miqdad and a US delegation, headed by State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism Daniel Benjamin.\n\nThe participants discuss possible future security and intelligence cooperation on issues related to terrorism, particularly on the Syria-Iraq border.\n\nWhat is notable about this US-framed communiqu\u00e9 is that the American delegation does not take any of the Syrian officials in the room to task for \u201cencouraging and coordinating\u201d the passage of extremist fighters from Syria into Iraq to participate in an insurgency against US forces. This accusation has become a key narrative advanced by Washington in recent years, so why not challenge the Syrians face-to-face when the opportunity is there?\n\nAccording to the Cable, Benjamin says \u201cthe two countries should still work to cooperate on immediate threats facing both the U.S. and Syria, including the proliferation of takfiri groups in the region, such as al-Qaeda, and stopping the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian response? According to the US Cable:\n\n\u201cMamlouk said the foreign fighters come from a large number of Arab and Muslim countries and that the Syrians detain \u2018large numbers plus their local facilitators.\u2019 As an example, Mamlouk said he handed over 23 Saudis detained in Syria to Saudi Prince Muqrin last year.\u201d\n\nThe US delegation even acknowledges the fact that the Syrians have been helpful:\n\n\u201cBenjamin commended Mamlouk on reducing the flow of foreign fighters, while encouraging further progress.\u201d\n\nAnd the Syrians offer additional cooperation, provided that Damascus takes the lead in these efforts:\n\n\u201cMiqdad interjected that the issue of foreign fighters using Syrian soil is a matter of national security for Syria. \u2018We have zero tolerance,\u2019 he said. Miqdad said Syria needs the cooperation of other countries, namely those from which the terrorists are coming. \u2018If we can close this circle - with us, you, and other countries - we will succeed,\u2019 he concluded.\u201d\n\nThe Cable does reveal some interesting information about Syrian strategies in dealing with terrorism, which Mamlouk says differs considerably from the American approach:\n\n\"The GID Director said Syria had been more successful than the U.S. and other countries in the region in fighting terrorist groups because \u2018we are practical and not theoretical.\u2019 He stated Syria's success is due to its penetration of terrorist groups. \u2018In principle, we don't attack or kill them immediately. Instead, we embed ourselves in them and only at the opportune moment do we move.\u2019 Describing the process of planting embeds in terrorist organizations as \u2018complex,\u2019 Mamlouk said the result had yielded been the detention of scores of terrorists, stamping out terror cells, and stopping hundreds of terrorists from entering Iraq.\n\nMamlouk acknowledged some terrorists were still slipping into Iraq from Syria. \u2018By all means we will continue to do all this, but if we start cooperation with you it will lead to better results and we can better protect our interests,\u2019 he concluded.\u201d\n\nA Free Syrian Army fighter reacts to the camera at the Handarat camp frontline, an area located beside Aleppo Central prison July 7, 2014. (Reuters / Hosam Katan) A Free Syrian Army fighter reacts to the camera at the Handarat camp frontline, an area located beside Aleppo Central prison July 7, 2014. (Reuters / Hosam Katan)\n\nWar of words\nThe tactics described by Mamlouk explain, in part, why Syrian forces today do not typically launch assaults on terrorist groups unless there is an immediate and direct threat to its military strategy of maintaining control over key areas and disrupting rebel supply lines.\n\nWhile groups like ISIL are viewed as a security threat, they have not always posed an imminent one.\n\nFor the better part of the Syrian conflict, ISIL has not controlled the \u201cpriority zones\u201d of the Syrian Army.\n\nThose areas have always been Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama and their surrounding countryside (Rif), with Quseir and Qalamoun, Daraa, Tal Kalakh and other border towns playing an important role. When ISIL fighters have been present in those areas, the Syrian Army has fought them - as in Qalamoun and the Damascus suburbs.\n\nIn early 2014, pro-opposition writer and researcher A.J. Tamimi questioned in detail accusations of collaboration between the Syrian government and ISIL/al Nusra. Among his many points, Tamimi notes:\n\n\u201cOne must ask what the regime would gain strategically by constantly bombing ISIS strongholds in Raqqa province, or ISIS strongholds elsewhere, for that matter, located far beyond the frontlines. As in the wider east of Syria, the regime lacks ground forces to launch an offensive to retake any territory in Raqqa province, and must depend on airlifts from elsewhere to maintain its remaining airbases. Hence, the regime is focusing its airstrikes where it has some real expectations of advancing: most notably in Aleppo city.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the Syrian air force did take immediate action when ISIL escalated in Mosul in June, which changed the geopolitical dynamic well beyond the Syrian-Iraqi border. Kerry is misleading when he suggests that Assad will not strike ISIL headquarters: this is about timing and gains from both a military and political perspective \u2013 not necessarily a response that trigger-happy Americans can understand.\n\nAs for accusations that the Syrians have released militants from their prisons to \u201cpopulate\u201d ideologically extremist rebel groups that will make Assad look like an angel\u2026 You can\u2019t have it both ways \u2013 political prisoner releases were initiated to defuse conflict and demonstrate leniency. Were some of these prisoners \u201cextremists\u201d of the variety that man Islamist rebel groups? Almost certainly. But that was the Sunni constituency that the Syrian government was also trying to placate in the early days.\n\nEven today, after grueling \u201creconciliation\u201d negotiations, the Syrian government is allowing these very rebels to \u201cgo free\u201d after they lay down their arms \u2013 this, according to volunteers involved in negotiations from Homs to Rif Damascus. What is to stop these same \u201creformed rebels\u201d from hopping over to al-Raqqa and taking up bigger arms? Should the Syrian government kill them instead? How does one win in a situation like this?\n\nCritics of Syria's prisoner releases should be reminded of the \u201cBig One\u201d carried out by the Americans in 2009 when they allegedly freed future ISIL \u2018Caliph\u2019 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from an Iraqi prison.\n\nDoes anyone have the right to point fingers after that monumental gaff? The fact is \u2013 from Saudi Arabia to Qatar, from Turkey to the United States, from Iraq to France \u2013 there appears to be plenty of complicity in fueling ISIL and the jihadi phenomenon. Is Syria complicit too? It depends who is asking - and why.", "source": "Share_bookmarklet (5085647995)", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/1087668598_10203096626151700", "subtype": "link", "received_at": 1412703801.9053, "media_type": "link", "type": "facebook", "id": "1e44e4964485aa80e066cc081fe22cb8", "tags": ["tab7"], "schema": {"version": 3}}, "language": {"confidence": 99, "tag": "en", "tag_extended": "en"}, "links": {"code": [200], "title": ["The myth of Assad, ISIL and extremism \u2014 RT Op-Edge"], "url": ["http://rt.com/op-edge/193848-syria-isil-assad-history-usa/#.VDQmE5D7Er8.facebook"], "created_at": ["Tue, 07 Oct 2014 17:43:22 +0000"], "meta": {"lang": ["ru"], "twitter": [{"image": "http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/53/80/00/assad.jpg"}], "charset": ["CP1252"], "description": ["It is difficult to find US officials directly claiming that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is in league with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), but you will find plenty who will allude to it using specious reasoning: US Secretary of State John Kerry is one of many who have sought to encourage this narrative: \u201cThere is evidence that Assad has played footsie with them (ISIL), and he has used them as a tool of weakening the opposition."], "opengraph": [{"url": "http://rt.com/op-edge/193848-syria-isil-assad-history-usa/", "image": "http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/53/80/00/assad.jpg", "description": "Who is to blame for the proliferation of extremist groups in Syria?

This includes an estimated 300-400 of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s elite \u2018Secret Apparatus\u2019\u2026 The Syrian dissidents\u2019 modus operandi will continue to be terrorism, particularly bombings and assassinations.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks: Syria\u2019s government and terrorism\nOn February 24, 2010, a Cable classified as \u2018Secret\u2019 was dispatched from the US Embassy in Damascus to the CIA, DIA, National Security Council, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Office of Homeland Security and a smattering of key US embassies in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nIt details the communications between Syria\u2019s General Intelligence Director (GID) Ali Mamlouk who dropped in on a meeting between Syria\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister Faisal al-Miqdad and a US delegation, headed by State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism Daniel Benjamin.\n\nThe participants discuss possible future security and intelligence cooperation on issues related to terrorism, particularly on the Syria-Iraq border.\n\nWhat is notable about this US-framed communiqu\u00e9 is that the American delegation does not take any of the Syrian officials in the room to task for \u201cencouraging and coordinating\u201d the passage of extremist fighters from Syria into Iraq to participate in an insurgency against US forces. This accusation has become a key narrative advanced by Washington in recent years, so why not challenge the Syrians face-to-face when the opportunity is there?\n\nAccording to the Cable, Benjamin says \u201cthe two countries should still work to cooperate on immediate threats facing both the U.S. and Syria, including the proliferation of takfiri groups in the region, such as al-Qaeda, and stopping the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian response? According to the US Cable:\n\n\u201cMamlouk said the foreign fighters come from a large number of Arab and Muslim countries and that the Syrians detain \u2018large numbers plus their local facilitators.\u2019 As an example, Mamlouk said he handed over 23 Saudis detained in Syria to Saudi Prince Muqrin last year.\u201d\n\nThe US delegation even acknowledges the fact that the Syrians have been helpful:\n\n\u201cBenjamin commended Mamlouk on reducing the flow of foreign fighters, while encouraging further progress.\u201d\n\nAnd the Syrians offer additional cooperation, provided that Damascus takes the lead in these efforts:\n\n\u201cMiqdad interjected that the issue of foreign fighters using Syrian soil is a matter of national security for Syria. \u2018We have zero tolerance,\u2019 he said. Miqdad said Syria needs the cooperation of other countries, namely those from which the terrorists are coming. \u2018If we can close this circle - with us, you, and other countries - we will succeed,\u2019 he concluded.\u201d\n\nThe Cable does reveal some interesting information about Syrian strategies in dealing with terrorism, which Mamlouk says differs considerably from the American approach:\n\n\"The GID Director said Syria had been more successful than the U.S. and other countries in the region in fighting terrorist groups because \u2018we are practical and not theoretical.\u2019 He stated Syria's success is due to its penetration of terrorist groups. \u2018In principle, we don't attack or kill them immediately. Instead, we embed ourselves in them and only at the opportune moment do we move.\u2019 Describing the process of planting embeds in terrorist organizations as \u2018complex,\u2019 Mamlouk said the result had yielded been the detention of scores of terrorists, stamping out terror cells, and stopping hundreds of terrorists from entering Iraq.\n\nMamlouk acknowledged some terrorists were still slipping into Iraq from Syria. \u2018By all means we will continue to do all this, but if we start cooperation with you it will lead to better results and we can better protect our interests,\u2019 he concluded.\u201d\n\nA Free Syrian Army fighter reacts to the camera at the Handarat camp frontline, an area located beside Aleppo Central prison July 7, 2014. (Reuters / Hosam Katan) A Free Syrian Army fighter reacts to the camera at the Handarat camp frontline, an area located beside Aleppo Central prison July 7, 2014. (Reuters / Hosam Katan)\n\nWar of words\nThe tactics described by Mamlouk explain, in part, why Syrian forces today do not typically launch assaults on terrorist groups unless there is an immediate and direct threat to its military strategy of maintaining control over key areas and disrupting rebel supply lines.\n\nWhile groups like ISIL are viewed as a security threat, they have not always posed an imminent one.\n\nFor the better part of the Syrian conflict, ISIL has not controlled the \u201cpriority zones\u201d of the Syrian Army.\n\nThose areas have always been Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama and their surrounding countryside (Rif), with Quseir and Qalamoun, Daraa, Tal Kalakh and other border towns playing an important role. When ISIL fighters have been present in those areas, the Syrian Army has fought them - as in Qalamoun and the Damascus suburbs.\n\nIn early 2014, pro-opposition writer and researcher A.J. Tamimi questioned in detail accusations of collaboration between the Syrian government and ISIL/al Nusra. Among his many points, Tamimi notes:\n\n\u201cOne must ask what the regime would gain strategically by constantly bombing ISIS strongholds in Raqqa province, or ISIS strongholds elsewhere, for that matter, located far beyond the frontlines. As in the wider east of Syria, the regime lacks ground forces to launch an offensive to retake any territory in Raqqa province, and must depend on airlifts from elsewhere to maintain its remaining airbases. Hence, the regime is focusing its airstrikes where it has some real expectations of advancing: most notably in Aleppo city.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the Syrian air force did take immediate action when ISIL escalated in Mosul in June, which changed the geopolitical dynamic well beyond the Syrian-Iraqi border. Kerry is misleading when he suggests that Assad will not strike ISIL headquarters: this is about timing and gains from both a military and political perspective \u2013 not necessarily a response that trigger-happy Americans can understand.\n\nAs for accusations that the Syrians have released militants from their prisons to \u201cpopulate\u201d ideologically extremist rebel groups that will make Assad look like an angel\u2026 You can\u2019t have it both ways \u2013 political prisoner releases were initiated to defuse conflict and demonstrate leniency. Were some of these prisoners \u201cextremists\u201d of the variety that man Islamist rebel groups? Almost certainly. But that was the Sunni constituency that the Syrian government was also trying to placate in the early days.\n\nEven today, after grueling \u201creconciliation\u201d negotiations, the Syrian government is allowing these very rebels to \u201cgo free\u201d after they lay down their arms \u2013 this, according to volunteers involved in negotiations from Homs to Rif Damascus. What is to stop these same \u201creformed rebels\u201d from hopping over to al-Raqqa and taking up bigger arms? Should the Syrian government kill them instead? How does one win in a situation like this?\n\nCritics of Syria's prisoner releases should be reminded of the \u201cBig One\u201d carried out by the Americans in 2009 when they allegedly freed future ISIL \u2018Caliph\u2019 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from an Iraqi prison.\n\nDoes anyone have the right to point fingers after that monumental gaff? The fact is \u2013 from Saudi Arabia to Qatar, from Turkey to the United States, from Iraq to France \u2013 there appears to be plenty of complicity in fueling ISIL and the jihadi phenomenon. Is Syria complicit too? It depends who is asking - and why.", "type": "link", "id": "1087668598_10203096626151700", "name": "The myth of Assad, ISIL and extremism"}}
