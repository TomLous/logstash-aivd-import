Just look around you and try to tell me otherwise. So, it makes you wonder what the hell is going through the heads of so-called Australians leaving to fight with extremist Islamic terrorists in Iraq.\nPeople who were meant to be everyday Aussies like you and me have jumped on planes and flown to Iraq to fight for the Islamic cause. A number of Australian men who have gone to join the fight have posted a video on social media urging their Islamic friends back home to come over and help. One of these men is understood to have died in battle since. Boo-bloody-hoo.\u00A0\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop has cancelled over one hundred passports belonging to these whackos and good on her. We won\u2019t be seeing them back in Australia.\nBut not only are people leaving the country to spread their filthy agenda, they\u2019re showing their support right from their suburban computers. \u201CAustralians\u201D are creating social media accounts and groups in support of the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. These posts include pictures of the flag of ISIL, and supportive messages to fighters.\nAn Australian Twitter user posted, \u201CISIS is fighting for the law of God and freedom, 100% support from Australia, The Media is all lies, the people love ISIS.\u201D Another coward posted this photograph on Facebook (Jannah means heaven):\n\nThese people are dirty, filthy traitors. It is as simple as that.\nAustralia is a country that deeply values freedom and democracy. Anyone who is willing to leave the country to fight against the freedoms they have taken advantage of is NOT an Australian.\nYou\u2019ve got to wonder though, why in the hell were they here in the first place? Who in their right mind would someone move to live in a country that completely disagreed with their values and has spent years on end fighting against them? They saw a soft target that was willing to accommodate them. Granted, we didn\u2019t know what they were really like when they moved to Australia, but while they were here, they were more than happy to take advantage of our healthcare system and other services that we consider rights. They are hypocrites of the highest order.\nThe worst of the lot are those who choose to remain in Australia and still offer their support online. They are cowards. If you want to live under Islamic law, I invite you to move somewhere else. In fact, every single one of you can go and join the fight for all I care. Then we can cancel your passports and never have to see you again.\nThis being a post that is critical of Muslims, I must stress that I understand not all Muslims are extremists in order to avoid being called \u201Cracist\u201D, even though Islam is not a race. There are many Muslims in the Australian community who go about their day-to-day lives like everyone else and are proud to call themselves Aussie. Good on them, I embrace them with open arms. My problem lies with the extremists who show complete disregard for everything we\u2019ve given them.\nThe Australian Islamic community absolutely needs to speak out against this behaviour. Religious leaders should be going into damage control and vocally denouncing the acts of extremists, sending a strong message to their members not to support terrorism and reassuring the public that Iraq is receiving no support.\nAustralia has no place for anyone who can\u2019t rejoice in its values and all those who disagree are welcome to leave.","tags":["tab9"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"salience":{"content":{"sentiment":-1},"title":{"sentiment":0}},"tumblr":{"id":"89445515265","blogid":"191512100","activity":"UpdatePost","created_at":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 10:13:57 +0000","blog_name":"calebbondblog","post_url":"http://thebondreport.cbond.com.au/post/89445515265/no-one-for-the-islamic-state-of-iraq-can-be-called","slug":"no-one-for-the-islamic-state-of-iraq-can-be-called","type":"text","state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"rZUvawsi","short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZOCOBn1JJNa01","title":"No one for the Islamic State of Iraq can be Called Australian","body":"<p><strong>By Caleb Bond</strong></p>\n<p>Australia is one of, if not the best, country in the world.
