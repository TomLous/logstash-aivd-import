It was an informal briefing on the expanded bombing campaigns to take place in both Syria and Iraq.  Halfway through the already very brief briefing, President Obama  stood up clearly agitated, and walked out of the room.\n \nThe casually dressed Obama returned to the briefing moments later with a senior adviser alongside him, though his mood continued to indicate he was still very upset.\n \nThe senior adviser made a couple of pointed remarks to the Pentagon representatives, reminded them the president had already had a very busy day, and then both she and the president once again left the room. Within seconds, Barack Obama returned again to the just concluded briefing, pointing at the still seated Pentagon staff and indicating how “inappropriate” it was to “try and paint all of Islam with the same brush.” The president repeated similar remarks, his mood going from agitation to outrage. His voice carried to several other West Wing offices.\n \nThe senior adviser, who did not originally return with the president into the briefing, suddenly re-appeared alongside him,  as well as the president’s personal aide.  She was smiling, and telling everyone “we’re done here” which she repeated several times and then led the president back out into the hallway.\n \n\"There are none so blind as those who will not see.\"\n————————————\n \nWhen you read this you will understand why Obama refuses to say the words \"radical Islam.\"..\n \nI didn't originate this, but it checked out with Google and Snopes…\n \nDid you know that we now have a Muslim government?\n \nJohn Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia.\n \nObama's top advisor, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live.\n \nHillary Clinton's top advisor, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed  Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.\n \nAssistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif Aikhan, is a Muslim.\n \nHomeland Security Advisor, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim.\n \nObama advisor and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati, is a Muslim.\n \nObama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North America is a Muslim.\n \nAdvisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is a Muslim.\n \nAnd last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama.\n \nIt's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in.
