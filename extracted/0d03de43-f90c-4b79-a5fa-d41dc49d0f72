Please sir, i'm curious to know!!!\n\nAnswer\nHi Johnny,\nTo understand differentiation from first principles, it is important that you get familiar with the idea of limits.\ny = f(x)\nand\ny + ?y = f(x + ?x)\nSubtracting the two equations and then dividing by ?x leads to\n?y/?x = [f(x + ?x) - f(x)] / ?x\nNow, ?y/?x is the ratio of the changes in y and x. When ?x becomes very small, the ratio approaches the slope of the function f(x). And so we define dy/dx (which is not exactly a ratio but a notation) as the limit of ?y/?x (i.e what it approaches) as ?x goes to zero. This now represents the slope function of f(x).\nYou should note that dx is not the same thing as ?x and in the expressions it is the latter that approaches 0, written as ?x ? 0. It doesn't suddenly change to zero, we just try to find what happens to the ratio of changes when the changes are very very small. Since y is a function of x, the change in y, ?y, depends on the change in x, ?x, and so ?y doesn't exclusively need to go to zero in the considerations.\n\nI hope it is clearer now.\n\nRegards","type":"thread","contenttype":"html","id":"1e3ed0d80a68a000e07245d964343e7a"},"demographic":{"gender":"male"},"interaction":{"received_at":1402399579.1459000,"schema":{"version":3},"type":"board","created_at":"Fri, 06 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000","id":"1e3ed0d80a68a000e07245d964343e7a","subtype":"thread","title":"Calculus_theory","content":"When calculating the \"rate of change\"  increase in x (dx) will suddenly change to \"0\" why?
