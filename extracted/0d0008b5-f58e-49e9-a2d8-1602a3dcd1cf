However, non-Calvinists are welcome to join, learn and participate. Please just keep your dialogue civil, and read and abide by the document titled \"Ground Rules\" (first link below). \n\nWe receive hundreds of requests to join every week. So if an admin cannot see anything on your profile that identifies you as a Christian, you will need to private message an admin (second link below) to inform us of your reason for wanting to join, or your request to join will be declined. We hope you benefit from and enjoy the group.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/CFDD1/doc/333545586663072/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/CFDD1/admins/?order=default", "name": "Calvinism Fellowship, Debate, and Discussion.", "privacy": "OPEN", "id": "214703171880648", "venue": {"street": ""}, "updated_time": "2014-06-26T13:39:51+0000", "owner": {"id": "507791931", "name": "Rett Copple"}, "email": "CFDD1@groups.facebook.com", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yj/r/PTNy7uD2P9g.png"}]}, "demographic": {"gender": "male"}, "facebook": {"to": {"names": ["Calvinism Fellowship, Debate, and Discussion."], "ids": ["214703171880648"]}, "author": {"link": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008291433440", "type": "user", "name": "Grayson Dole", "avatar": "https://graph.facebook.com/100008291433440/picture", "id": "100008291433440"}, "created_at": "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 21:19:45 +0000", "is_share": false, "source": "web", "message": "I'm not American, but I don't pretend that what America does doesn't impact the rest of the West.\n\nBeen following the news on ISIS and Iraq's request to America to bomb them. \n\nPraying for world leaders, as this seems to really be getting very serious and could be on the edge of some big things.", "type": "status", "id": "214703171880648_833260200024939"}, "salience": {"content": {"sentiment": 0}}}
