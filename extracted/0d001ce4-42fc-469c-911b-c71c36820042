As for beheading individuals and boasting about it, that is something that has no place in Islam. In this day and age the instruments of war have changed and hence there is no point to using swords and knives.  The torturing of a prisoner of war, or even one who will receive capital punishment, is not allowed. As for what these terrorist groups commit of torture and taking pleasure in that it as if mercy has been removed from their hearts, and so they are more resembling of drug cartels and thugs.  Those are the ones who spread fear with these types of barbaric actions and so they are their real sources of inspiration and predecessors.  \n\nSo in conclusion I wish to caution all of my Muslim brothers and sisters from being deluded by this misguided group or any other terrorist organization and advise them to hold fast to the Quran, sunnah and the scholars of the Muslims who are far from extremism.
