Russia is killing the people fighting IS, such as the FSA Free Syrian Army, a secular nationalist democratic group of 60,000, including 30,000 from the Southern front and 10,000 CIA trained rebels - forces Russia calls the \"healthy opposition.\" Less than 10% of Russia's bombs go toward IS or Nusra. For example, only 2 of 57 bombs hit IS in a given day. Just as Turkey used IS as a cover story to bomb PKK and other Kurds, who some consider terrorists and some do not, Assad and Russia use IS as a cover story to bomb syrian rebel groups. In russian media, every strike is described as hitting IS when IS has no presence for hundreds of kilometers.</p><p>Assad had been doing air cover for ISIS in Aleppo and now Russia is doing the same. Russia is bombing FSA and moderate rebels from the air as ISIS attacks them on ground with car bombs. The majority of those killed by russia have been civilians. Russia is dropping cluster bombs on syrian civilians that will become Unexploded land mines in the future. Russia is de facto allies with IS. IS gains its ground by conquering lands from moderate opposition, not from Assad who IS has almost never fought. IS is now GAINING ground in Aleppo (gaining ground for the first time in many months) and doing better than they ever have in Aleppo due to Russia bombing the only people who are fighting IS!</p><p>Under US bombing, IS lost 25% of their land including 1,500 villages recovered by Kurds. Usa kills 300 Isis per week and has dropped 7,300 bombs on IS costing $10 million per day and $4 billion per year and $6.5 billion total. Usa coalition has killed 20,000 IS and also thousands of IS buildings and hundreds of IS military vehicles. The opposition to Assad also fights IS and suffers 40% of losses fighting IS. They are the best allies for defeating IS. However, IS has recruited 30,000 from abroad and sometimes converts local syrians to join IS. Because of these recruits and conversions, the battle can look like a stalemate, but IS is now experiencing net losses due to losses on battlefield to US led coalition and defections.</p><p>Assad had an 18 month truce with IS and Assad buys his oil from IS. Assad primarily kills Syrian civilians like his father who killed 40,000 Syrians in Hama in 1982. The Assads are a family dictatorship like the Kims in North Korea and equally as creepy and evil. During the liberation of Iraq by US led coalition, assad trained and funded Al Qaeda forces to invade Iraq and kill Americans. 90% of foreign fighters entering Iraq came through Syria. Just as Turkey is accused of allowing foreign fighters into Syria now, it was Syria who channeled foreign fighters into Iraq for many years back then. These same forces have now turned on Assad in karmic justice. Assad released all the jihadists from prison so they would overshadow the democratic opposition to his totalitarian regime. Assad's goal is to kill all Syrians leaving only IS. Then he can ask the world to fight IS as Assad and Russia will never fight IS.</p><p>Assad was defeated in 2012 before being saved by the terrorist group Hezbollah. Then, in 2013, he was defeated again but was saved by the terrorist nation of iran. Now Assad, at the point of imminent collapse in 2015 is merely buying a little more time with russian aid. 8,000 irAqi Shiite terrorists and 2,000 Afghanistan Shiite terrorists are also joining the 5,000 Hezbollah Lebanese terrorists and 15,000 iranian terrorists and 3,000 russians.
