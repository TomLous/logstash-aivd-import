The group\u2019s legitimate emir Sami al-Aridi criticized the followers of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), describing the reluctance to fight them as a disregard for the blood of the Sunni people. Meanwhile, the emir of al-Nusra Front in Qalamoun seems to be distancing himself from the Syrian branch of al-Nusra. Will he eventually join al-Baghdadi?\n\nThe emir of al-Nusra Front in Qalamoun, Abu Malik al-Talli, did not change his policy towards ISIS. Despite the group\u2019s public policy \u2013 which considers the soldiers of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as enemies, fanatics, and Kharijites \u2013 the \u201cemir of the outskirts\u201d is keen to remain on good terms with his hard-line twin. Although ISIS\u2019 clerics have declared the al-Nusra followers as infidels, and despite the first fiery statement made by the newly-appointed legitimate emir of the Syrian al-Nusra Sheikh Sami al-Aridi \u2013 also known as Abu Maaz \u2013 in which he called for fighting the \u201cISIS soldiers, who have proved beyond doubt to be Kharijites,\u201d the son of the Syrian town of al-Tall continues to adopt the policy of disassociation.\n\nWill al-Talli eventually swear allegiance to al-Baghdadi, and thus become \u2013 according to ISIS\u2019 spokesman \u2013 one of the \u201chonest ones who God will eventually bring on\u201d -- also as circulated in ISIS circles?\n\nISIS\u2019 activities on the Lebanese-Syrian border related to the reorganization of its internal structure might indicate that the bearers of black flags, led by al-Baghdadi, will inevitably reach Lebanon.\n\nThis assumption is reinforced by the banner that was raised by the group, carrying under the \u201cThe Islamic State\u201d slogan, \u201cWe will target Shiites with bombs, from Diyala to Beirut.\u201d The picture of the banner was circulated on websites popular in the Qalamoun area, particularly the official page that publishes news about the group from the area\u2019s outskirts.\n\nAccording to security reports, the group is also preparing to launch attacks on the villages of Central Bekaa, which constitute a breeding ground for militants and include thousands of displaced Syrians. The group\u2019s leadership sees this expansion as inevitable, to the extent that an ISIS leader in Qalamoun jokingly told one of the negotiators in the kidnapped Lebanese army soldiers\u2019 file, \u201cWe are not in a hurry to swap the prisoners with some of the prisoners in Roumieh, because in all cases, within a few months, we will enter the prison to free them.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, al-Qaeda-affiliated websites have posted an audio recording for the Syrian al-Nusra\u2019s legitimate emir Sheikh Sami al-Aridi \u2013 aka Abu Maaz \u2013 who was recently appointed after the dismissal of Abu Maria al-Qahtani, who remains with al-Nusra despite rumors to the contrary. Aridi launched a fierce attack against ISIS, and called for fighting them because they are \u201cKharijites.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod has commanded us to use the sword in various ways, including the sword that should be drawn against the Kharijites,\u201d said al-Aridi, adding that ISIS \u201cis a category that has proved beyond doubt to belong to the Kharijites... and this has been proved without any doubt.\u201d\nHe referred to their description of al-Nusra Front as tyrants, saying that \u201cAbu Hamza is legitimate and others are fanatical and infidels. Fighting them is legitimate based on the teachings of the Prophet who said: If I live to see them, I will kill them as the killing of \u2018Ad.. Happy is the one who kills them and they kill him.\u201d\n\nHe justified his call for killing them by saying, \u201cThey refrained from applying the Sharia Law, have captured women, and have implemented all methods of fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, there is no room for reluctance in fighting them, because those who refrain from doing so are disregarding the blood of Sunnis... because you saw what happened in al-Sh\u2019aytat and al-Sharqiyah,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cWe do not want them to ruin the Jihad in Daraa and the people of Damascus. We must uproot them applying the Prophet\u2019s method,\u201d meaning to kill them.\n\nThis audio recording was preceded by a tweet by al-Aridi saying, \u201cJihad has taught me that leniency in dealing with extremists and Kharijites is disregard for the blood of the Sunnis and the Mujahideen.
