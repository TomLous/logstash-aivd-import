Christian towns are pillaged.\nFor over a year, hundreds of thousands of Christian families have been fleeing for their lives.\nThe only thing standing between Christians and death at the hands of these barbarians are the brave fighters who are willing to defend them.And now ISIS has reportedly unleashed chemical weapons on them.\nAmerica must take a stand against these genocidal jihadists. We must defend Christians.\nIf we do nothing, they will die.\nWe’re working in Congress to rally critical support and aid for Christians and to defeat ISIS. We continue to aggressively engage at the United Nations to raise this grave humanitarian crisis.\nJoin us in defending Christians. Be heard.\n\nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca0d0a9cf78cb3fc06f85a09c5562e70eb22f36895e672298734e838088e5b18ba \nSign Our Urgent Petition: Stop the Genocide of Christians Today.\n\nJay Sekulow\nACLJ Chief Counsel\n\nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adcaa5e8178005497cfcfabbb28215aa0e3d2d1fdf97f9de0ea649d58d45a5c088f0 \nContribute Now\nDoubleYour Gift\nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca0baff6137cc7a181fa03d283da9a905897b772e328d20c1a81c8804ecf3b8412 \nLike  \nf  \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca0baff6137cc7a181fa03d283da9a905897b772e328d20c1a81c8804ecf3b8412 \nLike this on Facebook \n\nTo ensure that you continue to receive e-mails from the ACLJ,\nplease add jay.sekulow@email.aclj.org to your address book.\nConnect to \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca68cba19e093306df9a06c6a8f5f48f1dd2320e8523ead1d5fc82578459595fe6 \nACLJ  on:\nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adcaf455f4ac36c80defe7bd4f118347cdf9d4456a74a4df2714015485144f679866 \nFacebook   \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adcae286b897e9b6280ae27e757bbbc83dbe97027e7b49e0b139ed32ff616e69eea5 \nTwitter   \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adcaa2979616d488ada39f64a0be6f416a45d47eef48f6672dae3eb2d6d5c6103adb \nYouTube \nConnect to \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca63b449046bfef86b247150d1b820e8cdfca82e27c29867337fcf98fe8948f5d2 \nJay Sekulow  on:\nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca63b449046bfef86b247150d1b820e8cdfca82e27c29867337fcf98fe8948f5d2 \nFacebook   \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adca698fc1ac4bd1ffac074068219a0e89400868c7d6afb22474c674aafe392b0a4c \nTwitter   \nhttp://click.email.aclj.org/?qs=e00f4b593bc6adcafa3189c31ada1177702d36ff0e37163525bfc0cd5634509503da0afcdd6fc347 \nYouTube \nThe ACLJ is an organization dedicated to the defense of constitutional liberties secured by law.\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice is a d/b/a for Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, Inc., a tax-exempt, not-for-profit, religious corporation as defined under Section 501©(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, specifically dedicated to the ideal that religious freedom and freedom of speech are inalienable, God-given rights.
