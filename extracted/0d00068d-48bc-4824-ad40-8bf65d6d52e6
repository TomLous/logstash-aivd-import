This includes promotional services. If you post six different authors in a day, you're flooding the wall and making your promo more like spam.\n\nPlease make sure your blog posts are writing related. If you have a feed sending in each blog post you put up, you might want to stop sending automatically and go to manual sharing. Yes, us writers have personal posts on our blogs at times, but if it doesn't have to do with writing, please don't share it here.\n\nIt's helpful if you provide an immediate catch word for your post. If you're offering your book for free - put Free Book somewhere at the top! If you're running a contest/giveaway, let us know up front. New release? Same thing. Scrolling in a group tis large makes it easy to miss things.\n\nNO PROMO for anything else. NOTHING.\n\nAND opinions/articles/even books and their links are subject to deletion.
