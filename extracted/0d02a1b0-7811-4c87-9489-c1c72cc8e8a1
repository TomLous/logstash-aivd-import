In fact, if we were to keep silence when we are called to sing our praise, the very stones of the church themselves may start to sing! (Luke 19:40) Singing is a true way of adoring God and we can learn from the angels in heaven who, as Saint John tells us in the Apocalypse, sing to God “day and night without ceasing.” (Rev. 4:8)\nYet Saint John also tells us at one point in his vision that “there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.” (Rev. 8:1) Silence is also an authentic means of adoration and so very essential for us to learn in an age when the noise level has become overwhelming.\nIn silent adoration we can hear God speaking to us. The prophet, Elijah, in a moment of dejection, once retreated to Mount Sinai where God had spoken to the Israelites in thunder and lightening. This time too, he saw fire and heard thunder, but it was only when the wind had died down to a whisper that he heard the voice of God speaking to him in silence. (1 Kings 19:12)\nAdoration can therefore be either silent or vocal, but there is one kind of noise that should never be found in our churches; that is, the noise of chatter and idle talk. We have our homes and offices and streets and back yards in which to conduct our conversations – but a church should be an oasis of silence in what otherwise is often a desert of noise.\nThe primary reason for silence when we enter a church is the presence of our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. In all our churches, the tabernacle is placed in a prominent position so that all can see that this is the House of the Lord, God’s dwelling place on earth. In the Old Testament times, when God dwelt among his people in the temple in Jerusalem, the prophets frequently had to call the people to order. “The Lord is present in his holy temple: Let all the earth keep silence!” (Hab 2:20)\nJesus followed in the tradition of the prophets. He regarded the temple as the true dwelling place of his Father, a house of prayer, and he was angered when its outer court had become a place of trade and commerce. The place where God dwells is no place for market banter. “My house shall be a house of prayer,” Jesus declared. (Luke 19:46) And his disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.” (Jn 2:17)\nWhen we come into the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, we are coming face to face with the living God. By quiet contemplation before the reserved sacrament, we extend and internalise the sacrificial prayer of the Liturgy. For many of the faithful, the only time they are able to enter a church is on Sunday, when they fulfil their obligation as Christians to participate in the liturgy. The Catechism tells us that “Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life.” (§2186) If, on this one day of the week, the church is filled with talk and noise from beginning to end, where are these people to find the silence they require for their prayer? This is a matter of charity. Even if we ourselves are not moved to join them in prayer, should we not be aware that our noise robs them of their opportunity for a quiet visit with Christ?\nMany have been converted to the Faith after the experience of entering a Catholic church and seeing people quietly praying before the reserved sacrament. They have come to see that, in Jesus’ words, “Something greater than the temple is here.” (Matt 12:6) Let our silence in church be a witness to all the world that God has entered his noisy creation and called it to enter into his peace.\n \n+ Denis J.
