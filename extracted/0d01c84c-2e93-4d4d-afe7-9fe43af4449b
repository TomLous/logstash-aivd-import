Until recently however, there was no digital SLR camera in their wide range of cameras. When Konica Minolta, a brand that had built up an impressive reputation in photography was in difficulties, Sony was quick to contact them. This finally resulted in a takeover of Konica Minolta's camera division which suddenly gave Sony loads of in house information on lens and DSLR. If the stories are to be believed, a lot of innovative technology that has not yet been launched on the market also fell into Sony's lap. It is not then surprising that Sony's first mirror reflex camera, the DSLR Alpha 100 has a lot in common with Konica Minolta's DiMAGE 5D. However, it is more than just a blatant copy. \n\nEssential Links:\nHome of the Minolta / Alpha-mount dSLR photographer:\nhttp://www.dyxum.com\n\nSony alpha photographer pool:\nhttp://flickr.com/groups/sony_alpha/pool/\n\nPhotoclub Alpha\nhttp://photoclubalpha.com/\n\nhttp://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/\n\nHelp Grow Sony Digital Photography:\n- Click \"Join this Group\".\n- Click on \"Invite People to Join\" from the menu on the right hand side\n- Select your SONY friends\n- Click on \"Send invitation\" ", "name": "Sony Digital Photography", "privacy": "OPEN", "id": "2215504229", "venue": {"street": ""}, "updated_time": "2015-01-06T12:52:27+0000", "link": "http://www.sonystyle.com", "owner": {"id": "761025155", "name": "Victor Leung"}, "email": "2215504229@groups.facebook.com", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yN/r/Jv8ZsURpIiI.png"}]}, "demographic": {"gender": "male"}, "facebook": {"picture": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s130x130/10923327_10152928533511438_5831454779632619714_n.jpg?oh=b9ebd930134d952f787d88f49e2850d0&oe=55274FF4", "to": {"ids": ["2215504229"], "names": ["Sony Digital Photography"]}, "author": {"type": "user", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=677801437", "avatar": "https://graph.facebook.com/677801437/picture", "name": "Tarek Zaki", "id": "677801437"}, "created_at": "Thu, 08 Jan 2015 14:00:58 +0000", "is_share": false, "source": "web", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152928533511438&set=pcb.10152819587224230&type=1&relevant_count=5", "message": "\"Speed\"\nSharm El Sheikh, Sinai - Egypt\nSeptember 2014'", "type": "photo", "id": "2215504229_10152819587224230", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"}}
