One of the targets was going to be a Shiite mosque. Today Paris is going through a series of terrorist attacks. \nAs usual people are blaming all Muslims for the attack in France. But let me be clear, groups like ISIS kill ANYONE who doesn?t follow their rules. They kill innocents. Muslims and non-Muslims alike. And I hate that we have to bring this up every time there is an attack. It takes away from the victims, but many times those victims are Muslim and they don?t deserve to be lumped in with ISIS. They are victims too.\nRIP to  those that lost their lives in these attacks.\n","created_at":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 17:13:36 +0000","id":"1e58af30a59aa00080071fabc201e775","link":"http://exposingonlineracists.tumblr.com/post/133160183850","received_at":1447521219.1041000,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"like","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"like","blog":{"id":"57989565","name":"housestaark","url":"http://housestaark.tumblr.com/"},"blog_name":"laurelofcastillo","blogid":"57989565","created_at":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 17:13:36 +0000","id":"000524834befa39d5094717a55e82176","meta":{"content":"Yesterday 43 people in Beirut were killed by extremists.
