When that didn't work they then tried taking out certain segments of the press.\n\nNow the whole News of the World scenario is a perfect example of this. Everyone assumes that the government went after the NOW because they were protecting the public that had been hacked. I am sorry to burst your bubble but that just isn't true. Politicians are creatures of self interest. If the NOW hadn't hacked politicians and members of the establishment then there would have been no investigation (or at least not until MP's were put under so much pressure by the public and started to lose votes).\n\nIt is a sad thing to say but the whole Milly Dowler situation would never have been investigated had the NOW not also been found out to have been hacking MP's at the same time. She would have received no justice for what is clearly an abhorrent crime against her and her families privacy.\n\nIf it had suited their needs the NOW would still be here. Unfortunately they went against the establishment and were duly squashed for it.\n\nBut you need to ask yourself a question. If the UK government were so transparent as they claim to be, why would they need to spend so much on their press budget?\n\nThe truth is that if you really new the sort of things the UK government get up to you would also realise that the press office at number 10 would need to be 10 times bigger than it actually is.\n\nTake the ukraine conflict for instance. The UK government along with several other countries supplies weapons to the Ukraine while calling for sanctions on Russia. Now russias involvement is not the issue here (I only call the fighters in donetsk pro-russian because ultimately they want to join the russian federation - i make no assessment on whether they are being supplied by russia - because the weapons they have could have easily been taken from ukrainian stockpiles when they overthrew the government in that region - a lot of the weapons the ukraine has were afterall supplied by russia to the ukraine) but the US and the UK continue to sell weaponry to Russia. They are deliberately using the situation to brow beat the Russian government while at the same time selling weapons to them. If they really believed that russia was arming rebels that would have been the end of arms sales. Ultimately however as usual cash is King.\n\nTake VX Gas as another example. VX Gas still is the most evil of nerve agents known to man. It was created in the UK and supplied to multiple countries. Syria, Russia & the USA are countries that actively admit to having it. There are also reports that say iraq had it and several other countries that are classified as threats to UK national security. So where the hell did they get it? Simple! Cash is key and Westminster is one of the worlds biggest arms dealers.\n\nTake a look at the pedophile ring within Westminster, brought up in the 1990's, Jill Dando knew about it and somehow she conveniently got shot in the head. Coincidence? Naw! Coincidences don't happen when you deal with the UK Government. \n\nLook at the corruption and you will realise a pattern emerge when it comes to the press. It is what is termed as BOXING or FRAMING - a well known propaganda tool.\n\nI will give you an example of what I mean.\n\nIf I paint an entire wall white then put a tiny red dot in the middle of it around 90% of people, although they may not mention it are going to be curious about that red dot. Its the proverbial out of place thing that shouldnt be there. The human mind wont let us just brush it aside, it is part of the human psych to question its reason for being there because it disrupts the order. That wall should be all white and that red dot is just out of place.\n\nThe press use a system very similar to it.\n\nSay for instance someone got a picture of Ed Millimuddle wearing a dress. The westminster press office say to themselves - Woohoo! we have our red dot. They make a big deal about it and the press comply. Suddenly it is in all the front pages of the news. Far from it being about being open it is quite the opposite. Straight away you get the massive public debate - the right say that its wrong - the left say who cares - the lgbt commuity weigh in, MP's have a say, the press goes bananas - it is on every front page. The people become transfixed by that red dot that is ed millimuddle in a dress (notice: this is just an example and I have no comment to make on Ed's dress sense - but my views on it are - who cares).\n\nThe whole of the UK is staring at the red dot not realising that infact they are now ignoring the whole of the white wall and are obscessed about this damn red dot. The issue is framed and polarised, the public can only see this frame that is red ed in a red dress. The radio has a sudden urge to break out Chris de Burgh records. \n\nTalk about taking your eye off the ball! It suddenly shifts and becomes - A GREAT DAY TO BURY BAD NEWS.\n\nNow you need to understand that the press world is a \"you scratch my back\" atmosphere. They get their bread and butter from interviews and those interviews are at the behest of Number 10. If number 10 says that a person is not getting an interview then they don't get an interview and they lose their bread and butter. So in return for lots of interviews and getting the word out on red eds red dress the press bury other articles on page 3 and 4. Westminsters press office gives them the nasty stuff on a platter, they write carefully worded press releases handing them to reporters. The reporters put these press releases on page 4 and in return they get more pop-like quotes for the front page story. People are so consumed with debating eds dress habbits they completely gloss over the fact that Westminster has been caught doing something dodgy, conveniently hidden in the middle of the paper. They concentrated on the frame while they should have been looking at the wall as a whole.\n\nThe other tactic is what I like to call the blame game. Now we all know the Yes campaigners have been protesting bias in the BBC since the very beginning - and rightly so! The BBC are very much biased against the yes campaign as backed up by several reports (one of which the BBC tried to get the professor who wrote it fired from his university).\n\nBut why do they get away with it. Again they frame the issue.\n\nBBC get accused of bias so what do they do? ofset the score. What they did and if you go on youtube and search for ian davidson and NEWSNAT scotland you will understand what I am taking about.\n\nThey get someone from the opposition of the side making the claim about bias - in this instance they got Ian Davidson. They then get that person to make a claim that infact no! the BBC are not biased in favour of the No campaign, they are in favour of the Yes campaign. That is what davidsons newsnat comments were all about. The presenter then makes a big deal about how discusted the bbc is about being accused of bias in either direction.\n\nSo what just happened? Well put simply, Yes who are actually not getting their fair share of press compared to No complain about bias, the No campaign who are actually getting more than their fair share subsequently say their is bias in the opposite direction (because it is in their interest to do so). The viewer is then left feeling - well! both sides are accusing the BBC of it so BBC must be right on the money and unbiased. In reality the bias is then free to continue in favour of no. The BBC win, the No side win (because they continue to get more air time) and the Yes campaign lose because they are still not getting their fair share.\n\nBut this tactic also has another sinister motive - it frames the issue again. It makes everything in the debate about bias and it frames it in that issue about bias. Subsequently the public are attracted to it in the same way that they are to the red dot on the wall (or red eds red dress) and ignore everything else going on. Better together bury their dirty laundry and the only group that suffers is the Yes side because they are prevented from getting their fair share of airtime and engaging with the public.\n\nYou need to all understand that the BBC right now (something not widely publicised) have another thing at stake at the minute. That is your TV license. At the minute it is classified as a criminal offense not to have a TV license, legislation that is somewhat unenforceable if you know the law. Now the UK government are changing that law in Westminster at the minute and transferring it from a criminal penalty to a civil one. \n\nSo lets have a little look at that shall we.\n\nWell at the minute companies cant really enforce a criminal prosecution without serious expense. In effect the costs involved would effectively create a situation whereby it would be more expensive to prosecute than they would get back (if they got anything back at all) in effect they would end up with a large bill and possibly get a prosecution but infact would still not get a penny from the poor sod that got prosecuted.\n\nMoving it from criminal to civil does something very strange to the situation.\n\nThe UK government is billing it (aided by the press - there is that scratch my back thing again) as simplifying the system and making it easier for the license payer. In reality it is totally different.\n\nAnyone who has had arrears on council tax will know that you get what is called a summary warrant. It is a civil notification that the council are pissed at you, signed by a sheriff or a judge, basically saying - pay up or we will extract the money direct from your income. Now these are processed in batches each week. They are sent to the judge or sheriff in batches electronically as a sheet - this is who is in arrears and this is how much. In many cases where people have gone into court to argue and defend themselves they have found (one case on the internet at the minute where the persons case was delayed until 12 noon but the order was signed at 10.30) that infact the order for payment has already been signed before their case was called.\n\nIt is one big machine. These are then sent back to the council in batches who send you a letter. The end result is that a sheriff officer then enforces them. This gives the council massive powers for collection. They can basically reach right into your bank account if you dont pay them willingly.\n\nThe same would apply to the BBC. If it becomes civil, they would process license fee witholds in batches. They would be signed by the court and then enforced by a sheriff - the BBC could stick their hands right into your bank account taking not just the license fee but also the court costs as well.\n\nSo they have an active interest in Scotland not getting its independence because of the new laws being written at westminster. You also have to understand that Scotlands license payers put more money into the BBC than they actually get back.\n\nIf Scotland were to become independent, the BBC would lose a lot of money!\n\nSo one of the things that better together use is the scare tactic \"YOU WILL LOSE THE BBC\" - which is true - we would lose the BBC because it would be replaced by the SBC.\n\nBut what would that mean? Well yes we would lose some programmes but not as much as you think. Understand that the BBC's programming is designed for the whole of the UK based on the preportion of the population. Strip away the entertainment side for one minute (that appeals to every part of the UK in different proportions based on the individuals tastes) and you are left with things like documentaries, the news and the weather.\n\nA perfect example would be yet another documentary on England's victory at the world cup in  1966. At the point this airs, around 90% of the TV's in Scotland watching the BBC change channel. Why? Well its not the fact that Scotland is anti-english.....because we are not (another media lie perpetrated by Westminster) - its not even that we are sick of hearing about a 60 year old victory! It is more a case of that Scots simply aren't interested in hearing about a world cup that another nation won 1966. It's nothing personal - they just want to switch over to something else.\n\nSo - that effectively means that documentaries etc that are not of any concern or interest in Scotland are still being paid for by Scottish license payers but not being watched. The same with the News. In a lot of cases people only watch the news to see what happens in London at westminster or something that concerns them within the UK. As an independent nation we wouldnt have a say in the politics of England and Wales so we wouldnt want to hear about it. So unless it is of interest to Scotland it doesnt get watched and again license payers in Scotland pay for it but dont watch it. It then goes to regional areas and of course a lot of Scots are interested and so watch it.\n\nSo out of a 60 minute block, maybe 15 minutes of it are watched by Scots. So we pay for an hour to only actually watch 15 minutes of programming. That in the grand scheme of things is not cost effective for Scottish license payers.\n\nSo we have become independent and we have the SBC. Well first of all, all those documentaries that had no baring on the Scottish people and didnt get watched in Scotland have been stripped away and that money is used to make documentaries that are of interest to Scotland. That makes the documentaries more cost effective for Scottish license payers. Then we have the news. A full hours about Scotland being watched by Scots again making it cost effective and interesting to the ordinary Scottish license payer. Rather than 45 minutes about things not related to Scotland then 15 minutes of Scottish news that is gumf or is infact comments from Scottish MP's on the same thing that the 45 minutes was about at westminster. Scottish Issues become prime supplied to the Scottish people. Cost effectiveness at its best.\n\nThen the weather - well firstly that damn image of scotland laying on its back to make it look smaller than the rest of the UK landmass wise will go in the bin. Oh yeah BBC! We noticed!\n\nSuddenly the weather is in depth and precise and all about Scotland - again cost effective. The slot used for the UK weather is no longer necessary and can be used for something else. So the combines UK & Regional News and weather that took up 2 hours suddenly becomes all about Scotland news and weather and only takes up 1 hour. Thats costs going down by 50% and freeing up time for other things.\n\nNow lets talk about entertainment. This one always makes me giggle. That we would lose things like top gear and doctor who. That is complete nonesense. What we would lose is programmes that never get watched in Scotland - we would get new exciting Scottish made programs as well. But on top of that we would simply make an arrangement with the BBC for the core TV programmes that we all know and love.\n\nThey say we cant have those programmes because we would be a foreign country. That is tosh! Just those two programmes I mentioned? Well! Top Gear is estimated to have around 350 million views per week in 170 different countries (it is syndicated world wide). As for Doctor Who - welllllllllll Doctor Who has been broadcast internationally outside of the United Kingdom since 1964, a year after the show first aired. As of 1 January 2013, the modern series has been or is currently broadcast weekly in more than 50 countries.\n\nSo there you have it - a very long winded rant about the press and the BBC - trust me though - this is only just 0.01% of the facts of the matter when it comes to the press in this debate. Understand! You are being lied to by a group that are in bed with the UK government and have their own vested interests in a No vote. Like I said before - money rules! and when money is on the table westminster and the press will lie, cheat, steal and do whatever is necessary. Of course you can rest assured that your tax money funds the number 10 press office, your license fee pays the BBC and together they will use it to hide the truth from you. Doesn't that just give you a warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nYOU ARE BEING LIED TO!", "source": "Facebook for Android (350685531728)", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/139582612882208_158398277667308", "subtype": "link", "received_at": 1406991015.0959, "type": "facebook", "id": "1e41a5441b65a180e0663bb26180256e", "tags": ["tab5"], "schema": {"version": 3}}, "language": {"confidence": 99, "tag": "en", "tag_extended": "en"}, "links": {"code": [200], "title": ["Update Your Browser | Facebook"], "hops": [["https://www.facebook.com/MartinJKeatings/posts/505310036266730"]], "created_at": ["Sat, 02 Aug 2014 14:50:08 +0000"], "url": ["https://www.facebook.com/unsupportedbrowser"], "meta": {"lang": ["en"], "charset": ["CP1252"]}, "normalized_url": ["https://facebook.com/unsupportedbrowser"]}, "enrich": {"facebook": [{"category": "Community", "username": "yeswheelie", "about": "Wheelie bins campaigning for Scottish Independence.

Rather than 45 minutes about things not related to Scotland then 15 minutes of Scottish news that is gumf or is infact comments from Scottish MP's on the same thing that the 45 minutes was about at westminster. Scottish Issues become prime supplied to the Scottish people. Cost effectiveness at its best.\n\nThen the weather - well firstly that damn image of scotland laying on its back to make it look smaller than the rest of the UK landmass wise will go in the bin. Oh yeah BBC! We noticed!\n\nSuddenly the weather is in depth and precise and all about Scotland - again cost effective. The slot used for the UK weather is no longer necessary and can be used for something else. So the combines UK & Regional News and weather that took up 2 hours suddenly becomes all about Scotland news and weather and only takes up 1 hour. Thats costs going down by 50% and freeing up time for other things.\n\nNow lets talk about entertainment. This one always makes me giggle. That we would lose things like top gear and doctor who. That is complete nonesense. What we would lose is programmes that never get watched in Scotland - we would get new exciting Scottish made programs as well. But on top of that we would simply make an arrangement with the BBC for the core TV programmes that we all know and love.\n\nThey say we cant have those programmes because we would be a foreign country. That is tosh! Just those two programmes I mentioned? Well! Top Gear is estimated to have around 350 million views per week in 170 different countries (it is syndicated world wide). As for Doctor Who - welllllllllll Doctor Who has been broadcast internationally outside of the United Kingdom since 1964, a year after the show first aired. As of 1 January 2013, the modern series has been or is currently broadcast weekly in more than 50 countries.\n\nSo there you have it - a very long winded rant about the press and the BBC - trust me though - this is only just 0.01% of the facts of the matter when it comes to the press in this debate. Understand! You are being lied to by a group that are in bed with the UK government and have their own vested interests in a No vote. Like I said before - money rules! and when money is on the table westminster and the press will lie, cheat, steal and do whatever is necessary. Of course you can rest assured that your tax money funds the number 10 press office, your license fee pays the BBC and together they will use it to hide the truth from you. Doesn't that just give you a warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nYOU ARE BEING LIED TO!", "author": {"category": "Community", "name": "Wheelie Bins for YES.", "link": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=139582612882208", "avatar": "https://graph.facebook.com/139582612882208/picture", "type": "page", "id": "139582612882208"}, "created_at": "Sat, 02 Aug 2014 14:49:51 +0000", "is_share": false, "application": "Facebook for Android", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/MartinJKeatings/posts/505310036266730", "source": "Facebook for Android (350685531728)", "type": "link", "id": "139582612882208_158398277667308", "name": "\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0441"}}
