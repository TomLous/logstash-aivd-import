Indeed, many experts on how the apartheid system was run claim that Israel's system of hafrada, or separation, is far more brutal and deliberately humiliating than anything devised by the racist regimes of Pretoria.\n\nMichael Ben-Yair, Israel's attorney general from 1993 to 1996, described Israel's approach to the Palestinian territories captured in 1967 as apartheid in 2002:\n\n\"We enthusiastically chose to become a colonial society, ignoring international treaties, expropriating lands, transferring settlers from Israel to the occupied territories, engaging in theft and finding justification for all these activities... We developed two judicial systems: one -- progressive, liberal in Israel. The other -- cruel, injurious in the occupied territories. In effect, we established an apartheid regime in the occupied territories immediately following their capture.\"\n\nThis system is evil, and it must be ended. \n~Rhys Fernandez-Tudor~", "name": "End The Israeli Occupation.
