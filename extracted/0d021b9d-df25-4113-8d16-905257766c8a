As you may be aware the Kurdish people have been the victims of yet another genocidal attack, this time by ISIS. ISIS have attacked our city of \u015eingal which consists predominantly of Yezidi Kurds (an ancient religious minority). ISIS regards Yezidis as devil worshippers, and its fighters have been executing Yezidi men who won\u2019t convert to Islam on the spot, taking away the women as jihadi brides. Many were forced to flee into the mountains to escape from ISIS, however, they are suffering in dire circumstances and many are dying from starvation.
