At one point I was telling her about some of the misogynistic beliefs of middle eastern culture. She looked terrified!\nIt just makes me think, how many of you liberal apologists that think the U.S. is evil and Syrian refugees are beautiful, innocent souls, actually have no clue about what?s going on there?\nOkay, women are gang raped and then they?re sent to jail for losing her virginity. Women can?t vote or drive and they can?t have education. Women are burned with acid for not covering their face with a piece of cloth. I hate to break it to you guys, it?s not about religion, it?s about maintaining their sick, misogynisic culture. Many Muslim women recently came out and said actually the Niqab has nothing to do with religion. 90% of married women in Egypt have had their genitals cut in the name of ?purity?.\nLike how can you sit around and support these people so strongly? This is disgusting. Sure, the U.S. has done shitty things. But those countries are no better and Infact they?re worse!\nHey just FYI, lumping an entire people & culture under the bracket of ?misogynists? and implying their way of life is backward is super racist. Also, if you?re gonna speak on behalf of WoC under the guise of feminism then you?re gonna want to at least provide sources for your views.\nI guess that?s true, not everyone in the Middle East is misogynistic. But it is a huge problem. All I?m really saying is that we need to stop viewing them as Angels and treating western culture like the devil. Ofcourse western culture has it?s faults and the U.S. has made it?s mistakes. But this idea that they?re just bombing innocent people for no reason, is sickening. \nThis whole situation is a mess and it?s so difficult to come to a solution that is going to help the innocent refugees, but also keep our countries safe. We can?t just blindly allow people in. Look what happened in Paris. I say we don?t let any refugees in. But most people disagree so I?m willing to bend my opinion. It sucks for the innocent refugees, but there are terrorists. One of the people involved in the attacks in Paris was a refugee who got in through Greece. \nWe need to figure out a better solution. This is clearly dangerous. \nAlso, my statistic of 90% of women having their genitals cut is from a book called ?Headscarves and hymens: why the Middle East needs a sexual revolution? by an Egyptian woman named Mona Eltahawy\nOk, you seem confused about whether refugees are (by and large) innocents fleeing situations of oppression and crisis or potential threats to western ~peace~ but I?m going to guess from your personal ?solution? of closing borders that you?re leaning toward the latter. To that end I can only suggest you read and watch *more* about the stories of the people you?re generalising. Refugees are fleeing the same things you?re condemning, they just don?t get the luxury of intermittent scares like we do. It?s their everyday. \nFor reference, two excellent films are: ?A Scream from Syria? by Ali Hammoudi & ?The Immortal Sergeant? by Ziad Kalthoum. \nAl Jazeera is also a great resource for Middle eastern political reporting. For example, this piece on why most Muslims are vehemently opposed to the caliphate (as proposed by ISIL/Daesh) and are persecuted for this very reason. http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/caliphate-isil-mosul-iraq-150609050758746.html\nAlso, according to french authorities, at least three of the attackers in Paris were born in France - Bilal Hadfi, Brahim Abdeslam, and Salim Benghalem\n(See:NPR) so the argument that refugees are likely to be terrorists in disguise is not particularly relevant in this instance.\nSure, I?ll check some of those things out. I agree most refugees really are peaceful people but we really can?t ignore the threat of ISIS. Most Muslims are peaceful people, but it took only a few to kill 3000 people on 9/11. The peaceful population was irrelevant. \nMost of the refugees in Greece didn?t go to Paris and kill a bunch of people. But one guy did. ISIS has released statements saying they?ve successfully smuggled 400 or so ISIS guys in with the refugees already. \nNot all refugees are bad. I?d agree 90% of them aren?t. But our PM Justin Trudeau in Canada has just decided to let in 25,000 refugees by the end of this year. How many terrorists is that? It?s very dangerous. \nI agree 100% that we need to help but it?s so difficult. This isn?t like other refugee situations. We need to be putting national security and safety over the refugees. We must take care of our own before helping others. We have to be proactive, not reactive. We can?t wait till lives are lost and then say ?oops sorry.? We need to be helping but just going about it in a different way, and I?m not sure exactly how we could do that. I?ve suggested tight security measures, check ins, government regulated bank accounts from which you cannot take out cash. It sounds controlling, but it?s a very small price to pay to escape the slaughter of their country. Also, if you?re not doing anything wrong, there?s nothing to be concerned about really.\nYou don?t have sources or evidence for anything you?re claiming, and it really sounds like you both don?t understand the actual context and lives of the people you are talking about and have no interest in gaining such an understanding. You can?t punish innocent people for something that you think they MIGHT do, especially when that opinion is based on fear and racial profiling. These people are fleeing for their lives and you seem quite happy to sentence them to death because of something they had no part in, no control over, no say in and that the overwhelming majority of them condemn and fear as much as you do. You?re buying into the panic mongering and islamophobia that creates more radicalism from the people that you?re alienating. Don?t sacrifice your freedom and the human rights of refugees to seek asylum because of a potential threat. Divisiveness is exactly what terrorism aims to achieve and all you?re doing is helping them. Don?t. Educate yourself before spouting your reactionary, unwarranted and uniformed opinions.\nGet rekt, bigot. PS, there are absolutely Buddhist terrorists - http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/buddhist-terrorists-incite-mob-against-sri-lankan-muslims/article/386848 And Christians. Remember Anders Brevich? Or the KKK?\nGreat contribution to the argument, actually. Very insightful. I?ll be sure to carefully consider your well thought out point that you have articulated to me so cleverly. \nSarcasm. You literally said nothing of importance or relevance. Good try, though.\n","created_at":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 04:39:38 +0000","id":"1e58ce535a3ea1008c713b9e52abde75","link":"http://were-all-queer-here.tumblr.com/post/133339552127","media_type":"text","received_at":1447735180.1870999,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"links":{"code":[200,200],"created_at":["Mon, 16 Nov 2015 23:03:00 +0000","Mon, 16 Nov 2015 19:47:39 +0000"],"domain":["m.digitaljournal.com","aljazeera.com"],"meta":{"charset":["UTF-8","UTF-8"],"content_type":["text/html","text/html"],"description":["","The establishment of a caliphate was sudden, but the emergence of ISIL was a decade in the making."],"lang":["en","en"],"opengraph":[null,{"description":"The establishment of a caliphate was sudden, but the emergence of ISIL was a decade in the making.","image":"http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/5/14/6b55651d3c6d4c69a93029f092cf1f2c_18.jpg","title":"Why the caliphate survives","url":"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/caliphate-isil-mosul-iraq-150609050758746.html"}],"twitter":[null,{"description":"The establishment of a caliphate was sudden, but the emergence of ISIL was a decade in the making.","site":"@AJENews","title":"Why the caliphate survives"}]},"normalized_url":["http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/buddhist-terrorists-incite-mob-against-sri-lankan-muslims/article/386848","http://aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/caliphate-isil-mosul-iraq-150609050758746.html"],"title":["Buddhist terrorists incite mob against Sri Lankan Muslims","Why the caliphate survives - Al Jazeera English"],"url":["http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/buddhist-terrorists-incite-mob-against-sri-lankan-muslims/article/386848","http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/caliphate-isil-mosul-iraq-150609050758746.html"]},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"post","blog":{"description":"<p>18/female/Canadian</p><p>Bisexual cis(she/her)</p><p>Super sassy and fun-loving</p><p>Feminism, LGBT, sexuality </p><p>Message me anytime babes (:</p>","id":"103871178","is_group_blog":false,"name":"were-all-queer-here","title":"GirlsKissingGirls","url":"http://were-all-queer-here.tumblr.com/"},"blog_name":"were-all-queer-here","blogid":"103871178","body":"<p><a href=\"http://laracantdraw.tumblr.com/post/133363190997/sister-cyanide-were-all-queer-here\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">laracantdraw</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://sister-cyanide.tumblr.com/post/133362445488/were-all-queer-here-sister-cyanide\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">sister-cyanide</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://were-all-queer-here.tumblr.com/post/133357472052/sister-cyanide-were-all-queer-here\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">were-all-queer-here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://sister-cyanide.tumblr.com/post/133352555653/were-all-queer-here-sister-cyanide\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">sister-cyanide</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://were-all-queer-here.tumblr.com/post/133347578252/sister-cyanide-were-all-queer-here-i-was\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">were-all-queer-here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://sister-cyanide.tumblr.com/post/133343983943/were-all-queer-here-i-was-having-a-discussion\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">sister-cyanide</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://were-all-queer-here.tumblr.com/post/133339552127/i-was-having-a-discussion-with-a-friend-last-night\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">were-all-queer-here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was having a discussion with a friend last night about the refugee crisis and the Syrian war.
