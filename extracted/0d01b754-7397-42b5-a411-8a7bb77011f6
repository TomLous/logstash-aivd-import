Since some still may be unaware of this treachery, the article explains what our stance as Muslims should be.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhy no Muslim should support the 'Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro'\n \n\nIn the last week a peace agreement was signed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine government. This agreement is known as the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro (CAB) and has been in the works for almost 2 years, amidst various negotiations and promises by both sides in the agreement. The Philippine government and the MILF have hailed the signing of the peace deal and many media sources have gleamingly praised the agreement, presenting it as an amicable end to 490 years of fighting between the Muslims and the Christians in Mindanao. None but a fool however would believe this, and the Philippine government first and foremost knows that this agreement itself changes nothing in the real world, nor is it an end to conflict but only a new stage in the Moro Jihad which has lasted for almost 5 centuries.\n\nAs Muslims we must be concerned with what is taking place between Muslims in the region and the Philippine government as it affects us all as an Ummah, especially the Muslims in Mindanao and the surrounding areas. The sad reality however is that most Muslims outside of South East Asia pay little attention to what is taking place here with their fellow Muslims and due to this many tend to take most of their information from the occasional piece by Aljazeera or headlines from the mainstream news agencies. It is because of this scarcity of proper information from a true Islamic perspective that many seem to have a very warped understanding of what this peace treaty actually means, so much so that I actually had some Muslims messaging me congratulating us here as if the Jihad had somehow ended and we had gained victory over the disbelievers! Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un...\n\nFor those who are unaware of what is actually happening, or even those who have some idea but do not understand things in great detail, I will try to present the correct understanding of what this 'peace deal' really is in light of recent history and from an Islamic approach.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that this peace deal is not the first of its kind, in fact it is almost a carbon copy of the last peace deal that was made in 1989 between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Philippine government. This former deal was the first peace agreement made which granted Muslims autonomy, it was this deal that created the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), the region which comprises 95% of what the current Bangsamoro autonomous region to be created under the new peace deal consists of. The new deal only adds a few cities and small villages to what has already existed for 20 years.\n\nSo why did the former peace deal collapse, why the need to formulate a new peace? The reason why is because the former peace deal was a load of 'tae ng toro'. The deal was never meant to last and it was designed from the beginning to offer nothing to the Muslims. In the beginning it was promised that vast areas would form the ARMM, but in the end it was cut down to an area so small that even the regional capital was not even included in it! Yes, that meant that the ARMM leaders were not even given control of the area that they assembled in. The whole deal was a farce, it began with grand promises but quickly devolved into the trap that it was always meant to be - a deal that favoured only the Philippine government. It was therefore no surprise that the MNLF pulled out of the deal and resumed fighting for independence from the Philippine nation, as they had seen first hand that there could be no negotiations with a nation that had been at war with Muslims since its inception and had shown that it had no intention at all to grant the Muslims what we had been fighting for. The ARMM was taken over by politicians that sided with the presiding government, and corruption and mismanagement became so widespread that none could take the ARMM seriously any longer.\n\nThe Philippine government was at loss during this period, as the MNLF had withdrawn from its truces and resumed fighting for independence, and the MILF who were based in Central Mindanao also continued to demand independence. The MNLF and the MILF were formerly united and were under the leadership of Nur Misuari, the father of the Bangsamoro uprising in the 1960's, however one of his commanders named Salamat Hashim refused to accept the peace deals that were being made with the government and so he broke off and formed the MILF which promised that it would not settle for autonomy, but rather continue to fight for full independence. Salamat Hashim vowed that anything less than independence was treachery and selling the rights of the Muslims. It is rather ironic then that after Salamat Hashim passed away (may Allah have Mercy upon him), his successor Murad Ibrahim began to work with the government on making a new peace deal that would place him as the new leader of an autonomous region. Was it because of the want of power that he betrayed the goals set by the founder of the MILF? We do not know.. However it became clear that Murad Ibrahim was ready to throw away all of the ideals set by the group and offered to lay down its arms so long as the Philippine government negotiated with it, letting it take power of the ARMM and turning it into the slightly different Bangsamoro autonomous entity. In a turn of events, the MILF became the ones to be hand in hand with the Philippine government, and the MNLF swore that it would fight only for an independent Islamic state, and it indeed took the first steps towards doing so by again declaring Bangsamoro independence in July 2013.\n\nAs Muslims we do not need to get caught up in names of groups, nor do we need to rally behind personalities. Whilst some, out of a sense of tribalism or personal preference may side with the MNLF or the MILF, or even side with another group or choose to remain neutral, the correct approach that we should have as Muslims is to first understand exactly what the Shari'ah of Allah teaches us in regards to matters of Jihad and rule over our lands, and then to see who is upon this correct way in order to know who deserves our support and who does not. In fact as Muslims this should be our primary concern placed over all other matters, and this means that as Muslims our allegiance is not to any one group regardless of what they do, but rather we have a united goal that we must fight for, and if any group adheres to this correct method then we support them, and if any group strays from it then we cannot support them. Indeed the path of Islam is a straight path, and anyone that strays from it and abandons it cannot be followed, rather we remain dedicated to the goal of Islam, whether the majority be upon it or even if it is only a handful of Muslims who are guided upon it.\n\nThe first and most important goal that we have as Muslims, as stated by Allah in the Qur'an is to expel the disbelieving invaders from our lands:\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u0650\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0647\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062b\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u0650\u062a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0634\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u062a\u0652\u0644\u0650\nExpel them from wherever they have expelled you, for fitnah is worse than slaughter.\n\nAllah commands us as believers to fight those who have fought us and driven us out from our lands that we ruled over. This means that we as Muslims MUST fight the Philippine government as they are the ones who have taken control of our lands from us and instituted un-Islamic laws upon us. Manila was ruled by Muslims under Rajah Sulayman, and he was fought and expelled. Mactan was ruled by Datu' Kalipulaku and later his descendants were expelled. ALL of Mindanao was under the rule of the Sultanate of Magindanao and ALL of Sulu was under control of the Sultanate of Sulu, yet we were driven out of most of Mindanao and much of Sulu was taken from us and un-Islamic laws were put in place and our lands were claimed as part of the Philippines. Therefore as Muslims we are commanded to reclaim every last inch of land that was taken from us, and Allah reminds us that fitnah (in this case meaning shirk/polytheism and disbelief) is worse than slaughter, meaning that it is far worse to allow disbelief to remain than to be killed. No Muslim can be content knowing that the cross of the Crusaders is raised over OUR lands and that our children are forced to pledge allegiance to a nation of disbelief. Rather it is our duty to continue the Jihad that has been going on between the believers and the disbelievers for 490 years.\n\nThe next point to understand is that it is an act of disbelief and treachery to ally with the disbelievers against the Muslims. It is agreed by all Muslims that anyone who assists the disbelievers in fighting the Muslims is an apostate and has left the fold of Islam, therefore our unity and alliance is ONLY with the Muslims and can never be with the disbelievers. Due to this it is clear that the MILF and its leaders have left the fold of Islam as they have allied themselves with the Philippine government to fight against the Mujahideen. Only a number of months ago the Philippine Army (AFP) attacked the Mujahideen of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and the MILF supported the AFP and deemed the operation necessary in order to ensure the success of their peace treaty. The BIFF were a group lead by Commander Kato (may Allah protect him) who left the MILF when they saw that the MILF had abandoned their demand for independence and began to make deals with the Philippine government. Whilst the BIFF Mujahideen continued to fight the AFP, the MILF in a great act of betrayal demanded that they cease fighting the Philippine government, and when the BIFF refused, the MILF allied with the AFP in a joint attack on the Mujahideen. This act of the MILF is one of the greatest and most horrible actions ever witnessed in the Moro Jihad, it was witnessed that they took the disbelievers as their allies against the believers and they spilled Muslim blood without valid cause, all because of their quest for power.. The AFP raided the bases of the Mujahideen and they removed the flags of Tawhid and replaced them with flags of the Philippines, and the MILF supported them in doing this. Therefore every Muslims must understand that the MILF, despite being founded by a true Mujahid, have become a group of sell-out apostates who are allied to the Christian Philippine nation and NOT to the Muslim Ummah.\n\nFurther to this act of treachery in siding with the disbelievers, the MILF sold any claim it had to call itself 'Islamic' when it signed the peace deal only days ago with the Philippine government and it declared via its official spokesman a pledge to support and establish democracy in Bangsamoro, and to accept Philippine law as being superior to Islamic Law. The MILF openly stated that it supports democracy which is a system of disbelief, as such they again made it clear that they are not at all Islamic but are rather servants of Malaca\u00f1ang (the Philippine presidential residence) and not representatives of Allah's Religion. Their further insult to the Muslims in affirming that the ultimate law of the Bangsamoro region would be the law of the Philippines only made it clearer that they have sold their religion entirely for whatever power they think they will gain from this peace deal. This stands in contrast to the goal of Salamat Hashim who said \"The ultimate aim of our jihad is to make supreme the Word of Allah.\" Indeed the MILF are traitors to their founder, to the Muslims of Bangsamoro and to the whole Muslim Ummah.\n\nSo now with the new peace agreement between the MILF and the Philippine government, who are the Muslims that are left upon the Haqq (truth)? It has been a blessing in disguise that via this peace deal the true intentions of each group and each person has been shown. Some of those who posed as Muslims have shown that they are in fact traitors, and those who are steadfast upon the truth have remained so. Among the believers who are still fighting Jihad in the Path of Allah are the Mujjahideen of the BIFF who despite the heavy attacks they faced continue to fight the disbelievers with an intensity like no other group in Mindanao. Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah, better known to many as Abu Sayyaf also remain dedicated to the establishment of an Islamic State and refuse to compromise or negotiate with the disbelievers, and they too remain active in the Sulu archipelago as well as western Mindanao. There remains a close relationship between the BIFF and Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah and there is no doubt that these 2 groups are the most open supporters of the Islamic goal of Mindanao. The third group which may be said to be on the right path is the Misuari-led faction of the MNLF, however personally there does remain some doubt as to what their actual ideology is. Since the foundation of the group almost half a century ago, their methodology has evolved from being somewhat socialist/secularist to becoming progressively more Islamic, and most recently with splits in the group occurring, the faction which has remained under the control of Misuari and his advisor Abdul-Khabir Malik have demonstrated that they no longer pursue peace deals with the government but demand nothing short of full independence for the Muslims. However, there still remains tensions between the MNLF and Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah and this is an obstacle to a greater unity of the Mujahideen. The Misuari faction remains allied with the BIFF, however its past history with Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah has proven to be a hard obstacle to overcome, and we pray that in time there will be a unity between the 2 groups that is based upon the right path of Islam.\n\nAlong with the groups mentioned, there is a new generation of Moro youth who have been inspired by the Mujahideen of our era and who listen to figures such as Anwar Al-'Awlaqi and other prominent English-speaking preachers who openly teach about matters of Jihad and Khilafah that many Imams in Bangsamoro are simply too afraid or too weak to mention. This younger generation have become fed up with the power-seeking elders who shamelessly ally with the disbelievers and they wish to see an Islamic revival in Bangsamoro just as they see happening all across the world. They have abandoned the flags of the Moro groups that came before them and have adopted the black banner of Tawhid as their symbol, and from my experience those who belong to this movement in this generation are so great in number that all they need is a unified movement and a charismatic leader that they can unite under and we will see insha'Allah a great force that will realise the dream of Moro independence and an Islamic State in Mindanao.\n\nI pray that all of those in Mindanao and the surrounding areas pay attention to what is taking place and they realise that those who are selling their religion to Malaca\u00f1ang are not our example nor even our brothers, they are traitors who we do not look to for guidance. Rather, we must remain steadfast upon the way of the Prophet and the commands of Allah and not compromise our identity ever, we must continue the fight for Islam and the establishment of Allah's Religion in our lands. Do not despair brothers and sisters, whether you be in the islands of Tawi-Tawi, in the marketplaces of Sulu or Zamboanga, in the masjids of Marawi, in the madrasahs of Cotabato.. Rather remember that we are united as one Ummah by Islam, and our identity as Muslims unites us with the strongest unity that there is, and with the Help of Allah we will be successful, do not stop asking Allah in your prayers for the victory of the Mujahideen in our lands and across the globe, do not stop praying for our unity and success, do not stop praying for the establishment of Islam and the Khilafah, and do not stop praying that you will be of the first ones who help to fight in the Path of Allah for this noble cause.\n\n[Postscript - Since this article was first published, the BIFF and Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah have both pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.

Only a number of months ago the Philippine Army (AFP) attacked the Mujahideen of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and the MILF supported the AFP and deemed the operation necessary in order to ensure the success of their peace treaty. The BIFF were a group lead by Commander Kato (may Allah protect him) who left the MILF when they saw that the MILF had abandoned their demand for independence and began to make deals with the Philippine government. Whilst the BIFF Mujahideen continued to fight the AFP, the MILF in a great act of betrayal demanded that they cease fighting the Philippine government, and when the BIFF refused, the MILF allied with the AFP in a joint attack on the Mujahideen. This act of the MILF is one of the greatest and most horrible actions ever witnessed in the Moro Jihad, it was witnessed that they took the disbelievers as their allies against the believers and they spilled Muslim blood without valid cause, all because of their quest for power.. The AFP raided the bases of the Mujahideen and they removed the flags of Tawhid and replaced them with flags of the Philippines, and the MILF supported them in doing this. Therefore every Muslims must understand that the MILF, despite being founded by a true Mujahid, have become a group of sell-out apostates who are allied to the Christian Philippine nation and NOT to the Muslim Ummah.\n\nFurther to this act of treachery in siding with the disbelievers, the MILF sold any claim it had to call itself 'Islamic' when it signed the peace deal only days ago with the Philippine government and it declared via its official spokesman a pledge to support and establish democracy in Bangsamoro, and to accept Philippine law as being superior to Islamic Law. The MILF openly stated that it supports democracy which is a system of disbelief, as such they again made it clear that they are not at all Islamic but are rather servants of Malaca\u00f1ang (the Philippine presidential residence) and not representatives of Allah's Religion. Their further insult to the Muslims in affirming that the ultimate law of the Bangsamoro region would be the law of the Philippines only made it clearer that they have sold their religion entirely for whatever power they think they will gain from this peace deal. This stands in contrast to the goal of Salamat Hashim who said \"The ultimate aim of our jihad is to make supreme the Word of Allah.\" Indeed the MILF are traitors to their founder, to the Muslims of Bangsamoro and to the whole Muslim Ummah.\n\nSo now with the new peace agreement between the MILF and the Philippine government, who are the Muslims that are left upon the Haqq (truth)? It has been a blessing in disguise that via this peace deal the true intentions of each group and each person has been shown. Some of those who posed as Muslims have shown that they are in fact traitors, and those who are steadfast upon the truth have remained so. Among the believers who are still fighting Jihad in the Path of Allah are the Mujjahideen of the BIFF who despite the heavy attacks they faced continue to fight the disbelievers with an intensity like no other group in Mindanao. Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah, better known to many as Abu Sayyaf also remain dedicated to the establishment of an Islamic State and refuse to compromise or negotiate with the disbelievers, and they too remain active in the Sulu archipelago as well as western Mindanao. There remains a close relationship between the BIFF and Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah and there is no doubt that these 2 groups are the most open supporters of the Islamic goal of Mindanao. The third group which may be said to be on the right path is the Misuari-led faction of the MNLF, however personally there does remain some doubt as to what their actual ideology is. Since the foundation of the group almost half a century ago, their methodology has evolved from being somewhat socialist/secularist to becoming progressively more Islamic, and most recently with splits in the group occurring, the faction which has remained under the control of Misuari and his advisor Abdul-Khabir Malik have demonstrated that they no longer pursue peace deals with the government but demand nothing short of full independence for the Muslims. However, there still remains tensions between the MNLF and Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah and this is an obstacle to a greater unity of the Mujahideen. The Misuari faction remains allied with the BIFF, however its past history with Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah has proven to be a hard obstacle to overcome, and we pray that in time there will be a unity between the 2 groups that is based upon the right path of Islam.\n\nAlong with the groups mentioned, there is a new generation of Moro youth who have been inspired by the Mujahideen of our era and who listen to figures such as Anwar Al-'Awlaqi and other prominent English-speaking preachers who openly teach about matters of Jihad and Khilafah that many Imams in Bangsamoro are simply too afraid or too weak to mention. This younger generation have become fed up with the power-seeking elders who shamelessly ally with the disbelievers and they wish to see an Islamic revival in Bangsamoro just as they see happening all across the world. They have abandoned the flags of the Moro groups that came before them and have adopted the black banner of Tawhid as their symbol, and from my experience those who belong to this movement in this generation are so great in number that all they need is a unified movement and a charismatic leader that they can unite under and we will see insha'Allah a great force that will realise the dream of Moro independence and an Islamic State in Mindanao.\n\nI pray that all of those in Mindanao and the surrounding areas pay attention to what is taking place and they realise that those who are selling their religion to Malaca\u00f1ang are not our example nor even our brothers, they are traitors who we do not look to for guidance. Rather, we must remain steadfast upon the way of the Prophet and the commands of Allah and not compromise our identity ever, we must continue the fight for Islam and the establishment of Allah's Religion in our lands. Do not despair brothers and sisters, whether you be in the islands of Tawi-Tawi, in the marketplaces of Sulu or Zamboanga, in the masjids of Marawi, in the madrasahs of Cotabato.. Rather remember that we are united as one Ummah by Islam, and our identity as Muslims unites us with the strongest unity that there is, and with the Help of Allah we will be successful, do not stop asking Allah in your prayers for the victory of the Mujahideen in our lands and across the globe, do not stop praying for our unity and success, do not stop praying for the establishment of Islam and the Khilafah, and do not stop praying that you will be of the first ones who help to fight in the Path of Allah for this noble cause.\n\n[Postscript - Since this article was first published, the BIFF and Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyyah have both pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.
