{"interaction":{"author":{"id":97268049,"link":"http://smithanon.tumblr.com/","username":"smithanon"},"content":"historyofhumanity:\nLets talk about Islam?\nSo as many of the tiny amount of people that follow me may know I have started to shift from european history to Middle eastern history. Middle eastern medieval history mainly revolves around islam and how it went from a religion to an empire then to a series of caliphates, then to an empire and then to a series of nation states. However there is a large divide in the remenants of the empire that we see today, mainly the divide between the two main branches of islam. Shia and sunni islam.?\nThe split between these two are about the death of mohammad and who should rule the muslim community after his demise. About 80-90% of the muslim world are sunni. The main players in the Sunni Community being saudi arabia who stands out as the richest and most influencial countries in the middle east, having massive supplies of oil. Turkey is the other main player having close ties with the west and being a member of NATO.?\n20-10% of the muslim world are shiite or shia. Whose sole main player is Iran who competes constantly with saudi arabia for oil and who has about 550,000 active millitary personel and who many suspect have the capability to make nuclear weapons making them part of an elite community in the world capable of wielding such military might.?\nSo what exactly is the difference between shia and sunni muslims?\nSunni?s regard themselves as a traditional and orthodox branch of islam. The word shia sunni comes from? ?Ahl al-Sunnah? (the people of tradition).?They believe that the companions of mohammad were the ?best muslims?.The sunni?s venerate all the prophets in the Qu?ran but venerate mohammad as the final prophet and they view all subsequent leaders as temporal.?\nShias on the other hand are derived from an early political faction ??Shiat ali? or the party of ali. They believe that all the descendants of Mohammads son in law Shia ali. They believe in being martyred for your faith and the concept of grieving this is a result of the sons of ali being denied a right of sucession. His son Hassan was poisoned by the leader of the ummyyad calipahte and his other son hussein dying on the battlefield. Fighting for his right to rule.?\nShia and sunni share some things. Such as worshipping in a mosque, the Qu?ran and ramadan. However sources of tension mainly come from historical and political tension. Such as the situation in Iraq where most of the muslims where shia. The sunni minority under saddam hussein was opresssing the sunni minority. When the US and the coalition forces invaded Iraq and a new government was installed. The shia majority started opressing the sunni minority. Not suprisingly the sunni?s started an rebel uprising and terroist groups like ISIS trickled in to Iraq.?\nThen the arab spring happened\nA series of democratic uprising and revolutions started in Tunisia and soon they were spreading like wildfire through the arab league. By the end of febuary 2012 the governments of Egypt, Libya and Yemen has been ousted from power. Civil uprisings had erupted in Bahrain and Syria and major portests had started in every country in the middle east. This inflamed the tensions as most rebels wanted equal rights for the minority branch. Such as the Bahrain uprisisng who wanted equal rights for minority shias.?\nWe haven?t even started on the kurds yet?\n","created_at":"Sat, 05 Sep 2015 23:37:53 +0000","id":"1e55427207a1ae808465d84d790df975","link":"http://historyofhumanity.tumblr.com/post/128438458922","media_type":"photo","received_at":1441496274.3871000,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"post","blog":{"description":"Canadian  master shitlord.
