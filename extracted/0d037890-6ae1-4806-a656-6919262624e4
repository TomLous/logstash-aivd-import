Shari Brasner, an obstetrician at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, tells Yahoo Parenting, noting that patients often go through it for health concerns. But choosing not to place embryos back into the mother because they would result in a baby of undesirable sex is going a step further ? one that?s been banned by some European countries and decried by ethical opponents as a means of creating ?designer? babies.?\nStill, the practice is growing stateside. According to the Post, one doctor with offices in New York City and Los Angeles has seen a 250 percent increase in demand for his sex-selection fertility services over the past five years. ?Just like everything else in this world, there will be people who will try to abuse the power,? says Brasner. ?But when the technology exists, and it?s out there, I don?t think it?s up to a doctor to say, ?I won?t offer this to you? or ?I don?t believe in it.? Then it?s the doctor playing God and that?s not our place, either.??\nSome family members didn?t approve of the Costas active pursuit of having a girl, she admits, ?but they didn?t interfere.? (The couple used contraception throughout their three-year-plus saga to conceive Olivia so as not to risk becoming pregnant with a boy.)?\nThe mom acknowledges, ?My husband wanted another child but always said that for him it doesn?t matter if it was a boy or a girl.? Still, she says she relied on Vincent for support when her resolve wavered ? and after she had a miscarriage in 2013. ?He told me that he knew how much I wanted a girl, so he supported me. He always kept saying, ?Let?s try. You can do one more time.???\nAnd now that she?s expecting Olivia, on October 31, Rose declares, ?It?s all been worth the money we spent.? Her sons agree as well, according to her. ?They?re older now and understand it better,? she says. ?They know it?s important for me to have a girl, so they give me all their support, too.??\nThe only thing left for her to do now is set up a nursery ? in pink, naturally. ?I?m still thinking about how will decorate,? Rose says. ?I only just started to make a registry. I was afraid of having another miscarriage so I wanted to wait until I was really sure and everything was OK.
