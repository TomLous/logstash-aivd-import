A human rights organization in Baghdad went on to say that Islamic State forced hundreds of civilians in  the town of al-Wafa, to leave their homes and threatened anyone who didn’t leave their house with murder.\n“The families, including women and children, were left in the desert despite the extreme cold weather.” The organization reported that 10 children have died in the desert so far.\nBy YASSER OKBI/ MAARIV HASHAVU\n","created_at":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 00:52:57 +0000","hashtags":["ISIS murdered 150 women and underage girls for refusing sex acts","woman","anwag","young rainey star center","DOL","DOE","NIOSH","GEND"],"id":"1e492e2db737aa8083ad751f1cec0575","link":"http://jkmhoffman.tumblr.com/post/105689269765/http-iranaware-com-2014-12-17-isis-murdered-150-w","media_type":"text","received_at":1420246377.8692000,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","title":"http://iranaware.com/2014/12/17/isis-murdered-150-women-and-underage-girls-for-refusing-sex-acts/","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"activity":"UpdatePost","blog_name":"jkmhoffman","blogid":"2445059","body":"<h2 class=\"entry-title\">ISIS murdered 150 women and underage girls for refusing sex acts</h2>\n<div class=\"entry-meta\">This entry was posted on December 17, 2014, in <a href=\"http://iranaware.com/category/3rd-world/islam/terrorism/isil/\" rel=\"category tag\" target=\"_blank\">ISIL</a>, <a href=\"http://iranaware.com/category/3rd-world/islam/terrorism/isis/\" rel=\"category tag\" target=\"_blank\">ISIS</a>, <a href=\"http://iranaware.com/category/3rd-world/islam/terrorism/islamic-state-terrorism/\" rel=\"category tag\" target=\"_blank\">Islamic State</a> and tagged <a href=\"http://iranaware.com/tag/isil/\" rel=\"tag\" target=\"_blank\">ISIL</a>,<a href=\"http://iranaware.com/tag/isis/\" rel=\"tag\" target=\"_blank\">ISIS</a>, <a href=\"http://iranaware.com/tag/islamic-state/\" rel=\"tag\" target=\"_blank\">Islamic state</a>.
