As an iconic adorner and educator in the beauty industry, Isis has maintained a presence in her community. She has also been actively involved in the fight for preserving cultural identity for African Americans in her decade long battle with the State of Texas regarding anti-braiding regulations. In 1997 Isis was arrested for braiding hair without a license. Although at the time, no laws in the state of Texas required braiders to be licensed, many in the community saw the arrest as an attempt by the state to intimidate underground braiders and subject them to the same requirements as cosmetologists."],"keywords":[["braids","isis","natural","hair","african","sisters of isis","dfw hair styles","afro","locks","locs","twists","hair styles","dallas hair","texas hair"]],"lang":["unknown"]},"normalized_url":["http://naturallyisis.com/about_isis.html"],"title":["Naturally Isis - About"],"url":["http://www.naturallyisis.com/about_isis.html"]},"tumblr":{"action":"create","activity":"post","blog":{"description":"<p>Not safe for work</p><p>Unapologetic Perverseness</p><p>Negus</p><p>Black, righteous, conscious </p><p>Nerd of many nerdy things</p><p>Ask and you shall receive within reasonable consideration</p><p>My penis gives fucks, I don't...</p>","id":"7583067","is_group_blog":false,"name":"sicksynse","title":"Synister...","url":"http://sicksynse.tumblr.com/"},"blog_name":"sicksynse","blogid":"7583067","caption":"<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://rudegyalchina.tumblr.com/post/129624837245\">rudegyalchina</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://coffeekisses13.tumblr.com/post/129524645393\">coffeekisses13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://rudegyalchina.tumblr.com/post/129409114865\">rudegyalchina</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hold up</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.naturallyisis.com/about_isis.html\">http://www.naturallyisis.com/about_isis.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that natural hair care got anyone arrested ever is sickening why is it a crime to not harm hair</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Policing black women and putting them in a marginalized beauty standard that we were never built to attain ?..
