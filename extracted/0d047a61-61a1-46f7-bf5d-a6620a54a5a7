Muslim?s are not terrorists and the ones who are make up an infinitesimally small fraction of the 1.7 BILLION Muslims worldwide. Let me lay some facts out here for anyone who disagrees.\n1. A recent study by the New America Foundation found that of the 26 terrorist attacks that have happened in the US since 9/11, 19 were carried out by non-muslims.\n2. As an American, you are more likely to get crushed by your refrigerator than you are likely to get killed by a Muslim terrorist.\n3. An F.B.I. study looking at terrorism committed on U.S. soil between 1980 and 2005 found that 94% of the terror attacks were committed by non-muslims.\nNot every Christian is part of the KKK, just like not every Jew is a Zionist, JUST LIKE not every Muslim is part of ISIS or Al-Qaeda. And before you get started on the ?Islam is sexist? argument, I?ll have you know that Islam gave women rights centuries before Betty Friedan convinced America; Islam gave women equality among men, the right to be involved in politics, the right to have a job and earn money as well as keep it to herself.

I should have said this a long time ago.\nEdit: I feel obligated to add that I completely condemn the Paris attack, as well as the Beirut attack, the Lebanon attack and the Baghdad attacks. However, putting more emphasis on Paris? attacks and condemning them more than the others is conforming to the ideals of Western Imperialism. Don?t place one nations deaths above another.\nEdit: Many american states are refusing to take in Syrian refugees in light of the recent terrorist attacks and I find that completely disgusting considering the fact that these are the people Syrian refugees are trying to escape from.
