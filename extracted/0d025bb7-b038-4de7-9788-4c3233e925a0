I grew up moving around a lot because both of my parents were in the Army and split when I was only 8 years old. I was born in Heidelberg, Germany, raised in Seattle, Washington and I became a woman in Augusta, Georgia. I just graduated college and now I\u2019m moving to New York to continue my journey. I grew up with just my mother, my older sister, and my younger brother by my side and it wasn\u2019t always the best of times, but they were all I needed. I would definitely say I experienced a very challenging childhood in comparison to most, but mama kept us in the church so even I could hardly tell how difficult it was because I always found the good and the God in every situation. Now, just like I have changed and developed at 22 years old, my views on religion have also. I still believe that I serve an almighty God who can bring me through anything this world brings me up against, but I practice Bohemianism. Those two facts are what makes me the ambitious woman I am today. Ultimately, I am a woman who believes in my freedom and in myself.\nMy addiction to short hair began my freshman year in college in 2008. It was the only hairstyle that made me not look like I was twelve years old. I sort of became a \u201Ckinky girl\u201D on accident. It just so happened that by my junior year I had cut my hair so short that I was \u201Cnatural by default.\u201D Once my kinks started to grow, I fell in love with my coils. They were stronger, softer, and healthier all around. I figured if I wanted straight hair it was nothing a quick weave couldn\u2019t accomplish. I didn\u2019t ever want to sacrifice losing my curl pattern. I also loved coloring my hair which is just about limitless for a natural hair wearer as opposed to a relaxed hair wearer. That was a definite decision making factor for me. I never picked up creamy crack again.\nI\u2019ve been natural since June of 2010. My sister is my hair\u2019s caretaker. She has nurtured my hair since I began my natural journey. We started my locs naturally and then added the kanekalon\u00A0hair extensions\nabout 4 weeks later. I started these loc extensions in May of this year, so they are fairly new. My natural hair has been blonde for a little over a year now and I have committed to wearing my hair blonde. I dye my roots every eight to 10 weeks, so wrapping my hair in the blonde extensions keeps the color of my dreads consistent all around. Another reason I wrap my dreadlocks is to protect my hair from breakage due to frequent bleaching and to make them thicker in width than my natural hair is able to achieve. Also, I can have longer locs faster without having to wait for my hair to grow out.\nI take care of my hair by not handling it so much. I wash my hair every three weeks with\u00A0Organix Sulfate Free Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo\u00A0and I condition with\u00A0Organix Sulfate-Free Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner. When I re-twist I use\u00A0Organic Root Stimulator Lock and Twist Gel. For daily use and hot oil treatments, I use\u00A0Jamaican Mango &amp; Lime Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil \u2013 the original one. I deep condition and do a hot oil treatment to my hair once a month. I bleach my roots every eight to 10 weeks and I use\u00A0Salon Care Prism Lites Lightener Blue\u00A0with\u00A0Salon Care 30 Volume Creme Developer. My hair is wrapped in\u00A0613 Afro Kinky Twist Hair. I am not a fan of \u201Coverly-neat\u201D dreads. I re-twist and wrap my hair every 10 to 12 weeks. I use an old, soft tooth brush on my edges sometimes when I need it, but I purposely refrain from using any edge taming gels or creams on my hair because I feel like your edges should be just as naturally rugged as your dreads. I apply castor oil to my nape and edges daily and to my scalp weekly.\nI\u2019ve learned that you should not take advice from every natural-haired woman. To me, my natural hair is my original hair. It is not duplicated and was specially given to me. In other words, what works best on my hair may not be so great for yours. Being natural is a lifestyle. Date your hair, make her your best friend. Create that relationship with your hair. Take some time to really find out her likes and dislikes, best styles, best regimens and things like that. If you have a hair crush \u2013 someone who\u2019s hair you can admire \u2013 that\u2019s okay, but find out what works best for\u00A0your\u00A0hair to achieve your similar goals. It always nice to have a visible goal for motivation and blogs and YouTube made a huge difference in my journey to be able to see other women\u2019s stories. It takes a lot to open up and be honest about the good and the bad of such a challenging journey. But for those that do keep a record of their natural hair online or off, I think it will beautiful to look back at even if they didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing it with the world.\nI think makeup is a great enhancer but I don\u2019t have a lot of it. I\u2019m definitely a basics kind of gal. I have a few MAC products that I acquired over time, but I do not believe that your makeup has to cost a lot of money to get the job done. My favorite feature are my eyes. I find them to be so captivating and fragile. They give away every emotion I\u2019m feeling whether I\u2019m trying to hide them or not and I can\u2019t help but to love their shape. I use\u00A0Sephora Collection Perfecting Cover Concealer\u00A0to highlight my brows and I useColor Me Beautiful Brush On Brow Powder in Brunette\u00A0to fill my brows. If I don\u2019t apply any other makeup on a daily, my brows are a must. Oh, and I love false lashes. Other than that you can find me trying out the boldest and brightest lip colors I can find at the nearest beauty store.\nFor my skin, I believe in two things \u2013 olives, more olives, and cold showers. Green olives happen to be my favorite snack and a cold shower is just about the only thing that can successfully wake me up in the mornings. When I cleanse my face I start by removing my makeup completely with wintergreen rubbing alcohol and then I wash my face with a cold washcloth and Jamaican Black Soap. I do not use lotions. I use extra\u00A0virgin olive oil\u00A0which helps to keep my skin soft and smooth.\nMy philosophy on beauty and self love is this\u2026You\u2019re someone\u2019s dream girl. The way you look, talk, act, walk is perfect to someone out there in this world. Always remember that. Until you find him or her be your own dream girl. Take care of yourself now the way you would if you found the person of your dreams already.\nMy fearlessness makes me a beautiful woman. I never imagined myself as such a powerful, fearless woman five years ago. I didn\u2019t always have the confidence I embody today and I definitely didn\u2019t see myself as an entrepreneur. I believe that if your ambitions don\u2019t scare you then they aren\u2019t the right ones. Courage and opportunity very rarely, if ever, present themselves at the same time in our minds. I was scared out of my mind when I decided to move to New York, but I wanted my ambitions to be a reality more than I was scared to pursue them. My advice to anyone else preparing to enter the \u2018real world\u2019 is to be confident in yourself. There is no limit to starting over in life. I\u2019m not sure that everything I came to New York for will come to past, but I know what should happen will happen. As for the rest of it, I have to exercise patience, persistence, and consistency and we will see what happens together. The worst answer you can get from anywhere is \u2018no\u2019, and in your mind all you need to hear is \u2018not yet.\u2019 Work harder, work smarter, and don\u2019t be afraid to start over. If you believe it, you can achieve it. A dream is a beautiful thing, but you get what you work for.\u201D \u2013 Isis\n\nFind Isis on her\u00A0blog\u00A0and\u00A0Instagram.\n\n\n","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"id":"6511364_13778630_100918569258","activity":"Likes","created_at":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 17:04:50 +0000","source":{"blogid":"6511364"},"dest":{"blogid":"13778630","postid":"100918569258"},"root":{"blogid":"193675702","postid":"100913699125"},"parent":{"blogid":"9534120","postid":"100918260277"},"meta":{"url":"http://neosixties.tumblr.com/post/100913699125/isis-nesbeth-writer-i-dont-really-consider","type":"photo","description":"Isis Nesbeth, Writer\n&#8220;\u201CI don\u2019t really consider myself from a place, but more so, of my mother.
