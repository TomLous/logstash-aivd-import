But no one has seemed to even notice that this is going on and that is unacceptable. \nChristians in Iraq, predominantly ethnic Assyrians, are being systematically targeted by the terrorist jihadist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Businesses and homes of Christians are being marked with the Arabic letter N, ن,  (pronounced “noon”), which is the pejorative Arabic word for Christians. Much like the Star of David used to mark Jews during Nazi Europe, the letter is meant to designate and shame Iraqi Christians.\n \nChristian families were given the deadline of July 19th to either leave Mosul, convert to Islam, pay a religious tax or die by the sword. Given the prosecution and struggle facing Christians, hundreds fled the city, taking little more than the clothes on their back. For the first time since the 4th-century there are no Christian Assyrians in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city. The Assyrian community had peacefully existed in that region even before the existence of Islam; but today, every Christian institution in Mosul has been destroyed, burned down or overrun by ISIS.\n \nThe atrocities against Assyrian Christians being committed include execution style murders, public crucifixions, beheadings by the sword, public displays of mutilations, and gang-raping of women in front of their children and husbands. Christian cemeteries, churches, important archeological sites and beautiful ancient Assyrian and Mesopotamian statues dating back some 3,000 years are also being callously destroyed. (x)\nWe have another holocaust in our midst, and with all of the social justice blogs that exist on tumblr, I’m honestly surprised and rather appalled that there has not been any attempt to get this news out. (Perhaps other Assyrians such as myself have made similar posts to this but have not received any support in making these issues known.)\nBut this isn’t something that just started yesterday. Over a month ago, ISIS crucified eight Christians in Syria for rejecting Islam. I wouldn’t have known about this if my mother hadn’t informed me of it because our media doesn’t seem to find this story to be worth covering. \nAnd the circumstances for Assyrians/Christians in the Middle East have only been getting worse:\nfamilies are throwing their children from the top of a mountain in order to keep them from suffering prosecution (x)on August 6th, a report from northern Iraq stated, “(45) children died of thirst… (1500) men were killed in front of their wives and families, (50) old men died also from thirst and illness. More than (70) girls and women (including Christians) were taken, raped and [are] being captured and sold. More than (100) families are captured in Tel afar airport.” (x)ISIS is systematically beheading Assyrian/Christian children and displaying their heads on spikes in a park (x)Mothers and fathers have lost all hope for survival and would rather see their children die at their own hands than suffer at the hands of the extremist group. Thousands of people are left homeless and on the run, dying of starvation, thirst, and illness. Children are being mutilated and their severed heads displayed. \nSo why isn’t anyone taking action? Is it easier to just play dumb than get involved? \nOr perhaps the atrocities in the Middle East are only important to the people and governments of western countries when they directly involve them.\nWhatever the reasons may be, inaction is unacceptable. \nSo now that you have been made aware, you know what to look for. You can search online and in the papers for more information about this genocide and help spread the word. Maybe then our western governments will realize that they can’t keep genocide a secret, even if it is happening on the other side of the world.\nPlease help my family.\n","created_at":"Sat, 03 Jan 2015 01:19:22 +0000","id":"1e492e68c2f4a900844b962ec5e46475","link":"http://theresadanger.tumblr.com/post/106957027169/putroclus-you-know-what-we-should-talk-about","media_type":"photo","received_at":1420247962.5785999,"schema":{"version":3},"subtype":"post","type":"tumblr","tags":["tab7"]},"language":{"tag":"en","tag_extended":"en","confidence":99},"tumblr":{"activity":"CreatePost","blog_name":"theresadanger","blogid":"90179399","caption":"<p><a href=\"http://putroclus.tumblr.com/post/94087162148/you-know-what-we-should-talk-about-the\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">putroclus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>You know what we should talk about?</p>\n<p><strong>The Assyrian/Christian genocide that is happening right now in the Middle East.</strong> But no one has seemed to even notice that this is going on and that is unacceptable. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><span>Christians in Iraq, predominantly ethnic Assyrians, are being systematically targeted by the terrorist jihadist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.
